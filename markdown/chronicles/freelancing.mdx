# Freelancing

There are those on Omen who believe in a life outside of being a wage slave. Living this way means any day could be your last, but with the promise of real food, freedom and fornication, for some there are no other options. This is not an easy life. Resources are scarce and feelings are hurt easily, tread lightly compadre.

## MARAUDERS

The oldest rule in the book, the quickest buck in Star City is taken right out of someone else's pocket. The proletariat is worried more about their score than their wealth, but those whose mind lives outside the box remembers material gain. Those who dream big, take from The 6, but most of them don't live too long.

## RASCAL

The goods are at point A, the seller is at point B, its never as easy as it seems. Only a true Rascal can avoid the cameras, bots and bastards trying to take your share. The non-corp economy of Star City is best left behind closed doors.

## FURIGAN

Furigans have competitions to see who can get their social credit the lowest. Some fight the system, some just fight. Furigans commit crime to openly defy authority and get the largest bounties they can. The code of honour is so slim between Furigan, they will cash in each others bounties. They will hurt, kill and destroy whatever they have to. If you offer them an incentive, they can be pointed in a direction, but any contact with them is dangerous, be wary.

## CYBER SINNERS

The aether-net is a jungle. Cyber Sinners were once known as "hackers", but the term is now considered derelict. Cyber Sinners are those who can bend the Aether-net to their advantage, and for a fee, to yours. But be wary, there are fanatics who believe that the code of the Aether-Net is a holy text, and will kill those who defy them. Cipher sentinels will stop it nothing to protect their tenants.

## TIDBITS

Tidbits have eyes and ears everywhere. Their market is secrets, and the store is always open. Disintegrating disinformation is a tough and violent rage against the propaganda machine of The 6. Tidbits either know it, or they know someone who does. But be careful, tidbits often have their hands in many pies. Words are simply that, words.
