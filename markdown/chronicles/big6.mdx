# The Big 6

## PATRIOT ENTERPRISES (Defense and Diplomacy)

Patriot Enterprises was not a founding corporation on Planet Omen. This company saw its rise in response to constant barrage on the Astridium Trenches. Patriot Enterprises sell death. They have multiple lines of military grade weapons and have mercenaries for hire. They appear to be breaking into new markets as they are set to replace the current wave of security bots created under The Forward Thinking Group, but have been delayed due to ethical concerns. Patriot Enterprises makes the majority of its profit from selling to the other 5 corporations and by terminating those who defy them. Patriot defences are volatile employers and have the highest rate of employee exile of any of the corporations.

## STAR-BUCKS (Produce and Living)

Star-Bucks takes up more space on the planet than any other. They have vast catalogs of merchandise and due to trade agreements with the other corps, have a total monopoly of essential services on Omen. With sales tactics so high pressure the staff carry guns, Star-Bucks has transformed the business framework on Omen from the "Customer is always right" to "the price is always right." Star-Bucks has the best loan shark business on Omen, leading to very severe cases of social credit leakage and are always looking for go-getters to chase up that debt by any means necessary.

## The Forward Thinking Group (Transport/Industry)

The Forward Thinking Group reside primarily in the Iron Isles. The motor companies of Earth united under one banner when going galactic, leading them to become the lead developers of Star Ship technology. The Forward Thinking logo became the unofficial flag of the streets of Star City with every vehicle blasting their Third Eye Logo through their headlights. In exchange for courier contracts with the Big 6, Forward monitors all movement of their customers and their vehicles and sells the data forward. Forward Thinking handle the registrations and maintenance of vehicles and with their stringent safety policies, lean the consumer to a Buy New mentality. Unregistered or unsafe vehicles often have their ownership revoked via Forward Thinking.

## FREEDOM FINANCE (Banking and Justice)

Even on Earth, people knew the banks were crooks. Freedom Finance broker on livelihoods and rental contracts. If you own a home, vehicle or asset with a required credit down payment, you are required to register your credit with Freedom Finance. Freedom run and operate the court system that upholds the social credit system and charged with maintaining propriety on Omen via Social Credit Guidelines.

## ORACLE INDUSTRIES (Cosmetics and Medicine)

Oracle Industries are cybernetic supremacists. All employees are either robotic or part-android. Their goal is to find the perfect blend of man and machine and they use their customers to test that. Why would you consent to that, you ask? Fashion, for one. Cybernetics is in. Secondly, Oracle Industries own 94.6% of all hospitals on Omen, and the others are field hospitals for Patriot. If you want medical help, prepare to sign your body away to a new piece of firmware that your credit is going to pay for. Oracle Industries are not liable for any malfunctions of technology from the Hospital program.

## EX MACHINA (Research and Aether)

Named after the God Machine himself, Ex Machina specialise in the advancement of astro-technology and have majority ownership of the aether-wave. Commercially, their greatest sellers are sims, data chips and their series of virtual experiences, "Journey". Ex Machina stems directly from the wars for total supremacy of the tech giants of earth including Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft. Ex Machina has the highest credit retention of the corps. However working in a developmental or back of house role requires moving into one of their facilities and cutting contact with the outside world. Breaking a Ex Machina NDA is an exilable offense.
