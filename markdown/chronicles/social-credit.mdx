# Social Credit/Wage Slavery

## SOCIAL CREDIT

The Social Credit system was initially founded on Earth as early as the 21st century. The premise of the system is simple: work, be passive and stay orderly, this will lead to a rise in your social credit score. If you are disobedient, belligerent or overtly critical of the government or systems surrounding it, your social credit will diminish. Your social credit score is managed by automated machines of Star City who are programmed to track your productivity, movement and overhear your conversations to monitor insubordination. If your social credit becomes low, you will be required to follow a "Productivity and Dutiful Conduct Plan" as set out by legal precedent REDACTED. If you do not follow this or your social credit score hits 0, you will be exiled to wander the surface and inevitably die.

## SOCIAL CREDIT MEDIATION

Social credit deviants are apprehended by the state and sent through civil court by the corporation in which the citizen has a citizenship contract. They are found to be innocent or guilty in holding up their obligations. If found guilty, on special occasions the court may find due cause to provide a worker with a "Productivity and Dutiful Contact Plan (PDCP), but in most instances, social credit debt results in exile. Social credit mediators are experts whose job it is to find fault in the case of a loss of productivity and ensure the appropriate individual meets court. Those who require social credit mediation are charged for any resources the state uses in attempting to prove their guilt, if they are found guilty.
