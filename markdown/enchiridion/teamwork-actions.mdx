# Teamwork Actions

These actions are best used in order to create openings, assist allies and allow the group to pull off team combos. These actions generally involve spending your turn allowing one of your teammates to do something very cool on their turn. Most of the resource recovery mechanics in the game are split between these cards meaning that in order to recover key assets the team will, you guessed it, need Teamwork.

<Callout emoji={'🕊️❤️'} heading="Some Expectations">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Do not force other players to use these actions to enable your turn.
            Each player is given complete agency of their character, regardless
            of efficiency. As a guideline, it is much more polite to offer to
            support another player than pressuring them into doing what you
            want.
        </li>
        <li>
            When you play one of these cards, it is with the intention of
            setting up a combo or allowing another player to regain resources
        </li>
        <li>
            Most teams in Omen will not last long encounters without using these
            actions to assist each other. Teamwork is critical to the
            experience.
        </li>
        <li>
            These actions can be used to preserve a combo orchestrated by one
            individual, but they are exceptionally harder to do.
        </li>
        <li>These cards assist players with every other action in the game</li>

## Adapt

1. _After Priority is revealed, you may Flip 1 to Gain Highest Priority_
1. _Choose a Character in the Current Zone_
1. _THEN EITHER - They become IMMUNE, OBSTRUCTED OR VULNERABLE_
1. _ACTIVE 1_

### Highest Priority/Active

The card's effect remains active from when the card is played until the end of the round which it is played in. This means that players cannot set up a condition for themselves to use, and must rely on a teammate to follow up. Adapt is retrieved as per any other card at the end of the round. It is important for Adapt to act before the action that enables its intended effect to work. For example, if you wish to make a player immune, make sure that your turn happens before the enemies attack the character you're protecting, or the Adapt has been wasted. If you plan on using Adapt, make sure to have that Light Token available otherwise you run the risk of your action not assisting your team mate.

### Immune

**_Elect a Skill. One ally becomes immune to attacks using this skill._** Immune is best used to block big attacks from a boss (such as a routine ultimate) or to fend off waves of enemies using the same skill. For example if The Scientist is surrounded by hordes of Bandit Marksmen, making them immune to Target could help them considerably.

### Obstructed

**_Elect a Skill. An enemy's skill bonus for defending with this skill becomes 0._** Obstructed is best used to create an opening in an enemies defence. If the team finds that a unit is repetitively defending with the same skill and your team is unable to get past it, then Obstructed may be a way to force some Overcomes past it. Be careful when using Obstructed repetitively. DMs are advised to play into Adapt actions when narrative provides, however if you keep using the same trick, eventually the enemy will learn and begin defending with another skill.

### Vulnerable

**_Elect a skill. When an ally applies damage with that skill, they Succeed with Style._** Vulnerable is used to chain Succeed with Styles. This is a condition best used with the intention of the party bursting the enemy down.

## Encourage

1. _Refresh Any Player 1_
1. _EITHER- Roll to Unlock another player's Aspect. If you succeed, Refresh Target 1_
1. _OR - Roll to Unlock any Defect. If you succeed, Refresh Self 1_

### Unlock Roll

To unlock a Trait, the player must describe the Trait that they wish to unlock, how their character unlocks it and which skill they intend on using to do so. They then make a skill roll to determine whether they were successful. The DC is dependant on whether it is an enemy or ally:

-   On an ally, the DC is equal to 6+ the number of light tokens of the target
-   On an enemy, the DC is equal to 6+ the number of light tokens of the user

<Callout emoji={'🤟🧠'} heading="When Encouraging, Remember">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Encouragement is best saved until resources have been spent to use.
            The DCs are lower, there is more likely to be things to unlock and
            the value will go further when you are lower on resources. Just like
            in the movies, when things get the most dire is when the heroes need
            their confidence restores
        </li>
        <li>
            Encourage's resources can be split amongst your whole party. You do
            not need to pile everything into one character.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any skill is able to Encourage as long as it makes sense to the
            Aspect that is being tagged. What is most important is building
            bonds between the two characters. Encourage is an excellent chance
            to roleplay two characters becoming closer.
        </li>
        <li>
            As a guideline, anything that would get an emotional reaction out of
            the character constitutes guidelines for encouragement. That could
            mean anything from something emotional to something funny depending
            on the type of game your table is running. Don't overthink the roll
            too much unless it's obviously a stretch or someone trying to
            justify using a skill they're better at. Story first.
        </li>
        <li>
            When unlocking Defects, the narrative is more focused on encouraging
            allies to continue fighting against a particular weak point on an
            enemy. "Hit them here", "I've found a gap", "That won't work, try
            this!"
        </li>
        <li>
            The DC for an Unlock action could change between when you play your
            card and when it is resolved. Make sure to coordinate with your team
            to keep the DC within reasonable chance of success.
        </li>
    </ul>

## Help

1. _Gain Highest Priority_
1. _You may Flip 1 to move any player who has not acted to any priority lower than yours._
1. _Refresh any player other than yourself._
1. _Create Momentum_

### Priority Manipulation

The idea behind Help is to set up your ally for a mega turn. By going first you are able to set up any resources your ally may need and letting them go before any of their enemies. This allows the player to get off their super turn before anything else can get in the way.

**Remember**

-   Help may conflict with other cards that give Highest priority. As with all cards, but especially this one, coordinate with your team.
-   Help goes really well with cards that have Lowest Priority
-   Help, along with Encourage, dish out a serious amount of resources. Momentum and Refresh together can lead to players getting very strong turns. If not, it is always helpful. If you are unsure on how to be helpful in your turn, throwing this card is always helpful.

### Pushing Back From Defeat

Help is very helpful for pushing the team back from a lack of resources. When the party has burnt through all of their momentum and refresh, a few turns of Help actions can put the party back on track to fighting back. Omen has an element of resource management and by allowing the party to regain their resources can push them from being beaten to beating the enemy.

<Callout emoji={'✨'} heading="Example Help Scenario">
    The team is having trouble with an enemy as they are out of re-rolls. The
    Scientist uses Help which gives The Gunner a Refresh and builds Momentum. On
    The Gunners turn, they Overcome and attack an enemy. Due to the momentum The
    Scientist created, the Gunner succeeds, which allows The Gunner to create
    more Momentum. With the refresh, The Gunner is also able to use his Trinket
    for more value.
