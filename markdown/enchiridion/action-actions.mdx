# Action Actions

Action Actions are for when you need to get something done. The sturdy foundation that Omen's wildness is built on top of. With these cards you'll be able to go where you please, take what you want and generally impose your will on the game. These cards involve the board mechanics such as health, zones and Momentum.

            These are the basic functions of the game. Move card, win card, and
            your special move. Due to their simple nature, the juice of story
            telling with these cards comes from the freedom they give to tell
            the story of your character.

            Boon's are often big turns for players. Most only get one and they
            may involve resolving large or long effects. When resolving a Boon
            action, take it as your moment to shine.

## Boon

1. _Your character's special ability._
1. _Once this is played, do not retrieve it._

Your Boon is your unique move. If you are unsure how it works, talk with your DM.

**Boon Reminders:**

-   Most boons are one use, so be careful when using them.
-   You lose your Boon when you take a Scar. Make sure to throw it out if you're running out of consequences.
-   A good Boon is one that is designed around the identity of your character, so when describing it, make sure to use it in the most "in character" way. As they are quite powerful, make these moments matter in the story. PANACHE!

## Explore

1. _Players in a zone you leave this turn may Flip 1 to follow you._
1. _Move 2 or Discover 1_
1. _THEN - You may Create A Zone Detail_

Explore is simply the card that helps your character get around. Explore is used for getting to a zone of choice or taking a step off the page and discovering something of their own. When using Explore for movement, your turn is likely to be quite quick. When using it for Discover, make sure you've taken a moment to consider the zone you are creating and its narrative consequence on the story.

### Follow

Following is a very powerful mechanic that **_when used as a team can allow the party to save several turns of movement._** Follow is best used when grouped and acting as a unit. When you wish to Explore, it is worth mentioning to other allies in your zone that you intend to do so which will enable them to Follow and play their own action card instead of having to move and then do it. These turns can be pivotal.

**_Follow triggers after each point of movement._** If a player is moving two zones, a player following would Flip 1 to Follow into the first tile and then if they wished to continue following, would need to Flip again to follow into the second. It also means that a player can follow mid way through a character's movement. For example, if the detective moves into the library where the gunslinger is, and then into the lab, the gunslinger can follow him into the lab.

### Move

Movement between zones is merely for positioning your character to achieve their desired goals. When moving to and from zones, be wary of dangerous zone concepts or the range of enemies. **_The Move option is simply for getting between A and B as quickly as possible._**

### Discover

Discover allows a player to define an otherwise empty zone and move into it. Discover is a mechanic that allows the player to experience building the world as the encounter takes place. When Discovering, there are a few key things to remember:

-   The zone needs to make sense within the context of the scene. If the party is a hotel, there likely isn't an underground bunker in it. Build things that make sense, but also push the story forward. Using the hotel example, running from hotel room 100 into 101 and making the same detail while accurate, isn't necessarily dramatic. Of course, if you need your character to move but are struggling with something, feel free to throw in the first thing that comes to mind.
-   The DM can reject a Discover being used as a way to spawn in plot conveniences. For example, if the enemy has a kryptonite, you cannot simply spawn a Kryptonite machine in the next room. The player is also unable to spawn in rooms for the explicit purpose of farming BP. Nice try pal.
-   The DM decides the flexibility of Discover. Certain directives and story points will require a lot of Fixed Zones to keep continuity. However in other certain situations the player may be given total freedom to define everything. It is recommended that DMs do a mix of games to allow players the opportunity to experience both, but that may not always be the case depending on story context, DM style and varying other factors. For example, the game takes place in a wild area, so the DM institutes a Campaign Concept that when a player Discovers they draw a tile from a bag which could have Loot, Enemies or Challenges associated with it.

#### Zones to Discover

Discover is used to travel to a tile that was otherwise inaccessible.

**Predetermined Zones:** A zone that has nothing in it that the DM has put on the board ahead of time. This can be prompted by the DM to allow players to build on the story world by defining a part of it or to ensure players stick within a certain boundary. Predetermined zones are often represented by a zone with a large question mark placed on the board.

**Undiscovered Zones:** Undiscovered Zones are zones that the DM has defined the player has been unable to access or perceive until entering them. When Discovering an Undiscovered zone, the DM informs the player what is in the zone. Once Discovered, an undiscovered zone becomes Discovered, allowing alternate movement effects to enter this zone. Discovering these zones can be important as Discovery movement is the only way in initially which will allow your team more options in their movement and positioning. Undiscovered zones are often represented by an eye icon in the zone.

**Difficult Terrain:** Difficult Terrain is a regular zone that requires Discovering to move in and out of. These zones are often there to either create an interesting challenge in the encounter by limiting movement or building a sense of discomfort and effort when moving between zones. Difficult terrain is often indicated by a mountain icon or a unique marker depending on the concept of the zone.

**Free Zones:** Unless the DM or Directive explicitly say otherwise, players are able to discover tiles by simply walking into an empty space on the board and stating what it is. These rules are often used in cases of player directed world building or when certain directive enable it such as the Flee Directive. Free Zones are when players should be the strictest in following the Discover guidelines, as the DM is trusting them to continue building a cohesive story world with them.

#### Create a Zone Detail

When creating a Zone Detail with Explore, think in the simplest possible terms **_"What is something in this room that could be helpful or flavourful?"_** If nothing springs to mind, simply skip this step. This is a may text. Leaving a Zone Detail everywhere you go is not particularly fun or optimal and simply clutters the board. These zone details generally only come up to enable minor story progression or when interacting with concepts. Don't Overthink it.

## Overcome

1. _Flip 1 to Move 1 to a Discovered Zone_
1. _Roll an Overcome Roll against an enemy in this zone_
1. _If you succeed, Create Momentum_

When Overcoming, this character makes an effort to achieve victory within the context of the scene. This character overcomes the situation. It is about doing what is required to win. Even in combat, that does not mean that you have to deal damage or attack someone. The best ways to achieve success in Omen are often the most creative. The enemy in any scene may not necessarily be an attackable entity. An encounter could be based on literally anything, so make sure in character creation to diversify your skill list. Common non-combat encounters could include rescue, escape, conversation, performing a task, staying hidden, stealing or an amalgamation of many at once.

Make sure to allow flexibility in your thinking when figuring out how to defeat an enemy. An example could be a detective character who can't quite Target a Speedy character. They could instead Overcome with Inspect by detecting predictable patterns in their movement. Depending on DM ruling, this character may not be able to defend with Speed against this as they will still act in the same pattern, forcing them to defend with other skills. This benefits the detective character by forcing the Speedy enemy off of their primary skill.

Any skill can potentially be used to defeat an enemy. Omen's key rule is that if it makes sense in the scenario, then it's possible. If you're planning on using a skill that is obscure, make sure that there is context to it. For example, a doctor may want to attack with Anatomy. In this example, it could be explained as "My doctor knows exactly where to hit him so he does not require much force." While against a grunt that may work, but what about an enemy that is super fast? This enemy likely defends with Speed, so force has very little to do with it. If these contexts don't appear often in game, there is always the option of creating concepts that allow your character to attack with that skill or spending BP for attachments that allow you to attack with that skill.

<Callout emoji={'🤔💭'} heading="Example Concept">
    Body Mass Index: When attacking enemies larger than them, players may use
    Anatomy.
</Callout>

<Callout emoji={'🔌📎'} heading="Example Attachment">
    Body Mass Index: This character gains +2 Anatomy against unarmoured enemies.
    This character has narrative permission to Overcome with Anatomy against any
    unarmoured target that is bigger than them.
</Callout>

### Flip 1 to Move

This is required to be done before the Overcome. A Discovered Zone is a zone that is already revealed on the map.

### Overcome Roll

An Overcome roll is used to close chains. When overcoming, the first step is to choose which chain this character is attempting to overcome. Then, the player must describe how they wish to Overcome the situation and which skill they intend to use. Once the player has described the narrative of their Overcome, the DM describes how the enemy or encounter defends and which skill they are defending with. Both sides roll openly. After both sides have rolled, they may begin using Aspects and Momentum to manipulate the results. This is done simultaneously and the side with the highest total wins. Once both sides are done, the DM lets the player know if they succeeded. On a success, the player deals a link of damage to the chain they selected.

### Succeed With Style

If they succeed by more than double, then they "Succeed with Style." Succeeding with Style means the player deals an additional link of damage and may apply one of the following effects:

-   Create a Defect on the Enemy
-   Examine this Enemy
-   Refresh Any Player 1

### Building Momentum

Describe how your attempts to Overcome the situation have started generating Momentum for your team. In the context of Overcome this could include creating opportunities against an enemy, inspiring those around you, building confidence or gaining the upper hand on the situation. Remember that Momentum is intended to be used as a Team Resource, so the vaguer it is, generally the better. If you can't think of anything on the spot, don't stress and throw in the first thing to come to mind. Naming momentum is a fun flavour thing in most cases. Momentum is built incredibly often and carries no narrative permission, so just have fun with it.
