# Enemies, Challenges and Classifications

## Enemy Classifications

### Minors (Goons)

Minors are the types of unnamed enemies that exist to soak hits for the big bads and put the players under pressure by hitting them occasionally. They're the enemies that a player can defeat hundreds of and it makes sense within the story world. A minor's role should be to absorb resources the players wish to put elsewhere to make other fights challenging. They are not normally in the limelight of the encounter.

-   Minors do not have uniques or routines
-   A minor has 1-3 primary skills
-   Minors operate as a one hit box card that appears in an area. A common way to run minors is with a spawn that creates them endlessly unless the players remove them.

### Moderates (Leader)

Moderate enemies are

Moderates are the primary enemy of the encounter and thus need to be challenging, but not game breaking. Moderates often have:

-   A routine with a guaranteed foreshadow step before the ultimate and one unique
-   3-7 skills, with at maximum one at 5 and the rest at 3 or lower
-   5-8 links split between varying chains with at least one positive vanquish
-   Moderate have approximately 3 aspects

### Majors (Boss)

Majors are boss encounters that are only limited by how hard you want to challenge your players. These types of encounters should be reserved for pivotal story moments or situations the party has put themselves in that would face severe resistance. These characters are ones powerful enough to have their own character sheet.

Boss fights are the type of enemy to cause scars. With this in mind, make sure to have plenty of foreshadowing and opportunity for the players to escape/retreat if it turns sour. Remember to remind players that retreat is not the end, but the beginning of a new story point.

-   Majors often have a powerful, flashy routine with high DCs and powerful abilities
-   When designing a Major's unique, make sure to do it in a way that disrupts the party's usual plan or targets a specific weak spot of theirs.
-   Take advantage of skill immunities to pose a unique challenge to your players
-   Major's can have as many skill points as you would like. Major's may easily break the 5+ skill thresh-hold. With any enemy, it's important to build a weakness into your characters. Make sure this character is not completely indestructible. If you wish to portray highly proficient characters, high skills and moderate health is the easiest way to demonstrate that.
-   Chains can be distributed as freely as you would like but remember to consider that large hp enemies lead to long games if the only way is through them. When trying to simulate a large powerful creature having lots of health with obvious gaps in their skill array is the easiest way to demonstrate that.
-   Vanquishes in big fights should be a boon to the players in most instances. This will give them a wave of hope that they will be able to take down the insurmountable task in front of them. Giving the players recurring rewards is a good way to keep combat immersive.
-   Major's generally have 5+ aspects to represent their likeness to player strength.
