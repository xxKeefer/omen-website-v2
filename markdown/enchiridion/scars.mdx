# Scars

When a player fills all of their consequences boxes, they take a 'Scar.'

-   When the player takes the Scar this player must discard the Overcome, Boon and Invent card from their hand and remove them from play. If they have one of these in the priority line and have not acted, they may replace that card with one from their hand. The player must then choose: Endure, Survive or Inspire and create the concept accordingly. A player that has no cards left for any reason is unable to take actions.
-   **"X is SURVIVING":** A surviving character cannot be targeted by enemies. At the end of each round following this one, a "Surviving"' character must discard one of their cards from play. When this character runs out of cards, they are still functioning and able to help with narrative permissions, but are unable to take actions. A character that is 'Surviving' should have narrative permission in association with being heavily wounded or unable to continue fighting.
-   **" X IS ENDURING":** Each time this player takes damage for the rest of this game they remove one of their cards from play. If this player runs out of cards, they are rendered completely incapacatated and take an additional scar.
-   **"X IS INSPIRING":** The character goes down in such a way that inspires their compatriots to continue fighting. This character Creates an Advantage. This player must remove all of their cards from play, but in return every ally who witnesses their blaze of glory may refresh 1 and unlock an aspect. The character than becomes incapacitated but cannot be targeted by enemies.

## Scar Aspects

At the end of the game, this scar becomes an Aspect that remains on their character sheet that the player cannot interact with, but the DM can. When naming the Aspect with the player, make sure to make it something compelling that doesn't prevent the player from having fun or destroying the identity of their character. Functionally, a scar may be utilised by an enemy when rolling against this player. Rather than a monster tagging one of their own Aspects, an enemy may tag one of the player's Scars. When doing so, they still Refresh that player by one, but their concept remains unlocked for later use. The DM may also use these scars as a way of justifying narrative permission when it applies in the story. Scars are intended to be a unique challenge for the player and not limiting, so be careful when invoking a Scar to continue enabling player freedom.

## Reaching the Scar Limit/ Character "Death"

A player may have a maximum of 3 scars. If a player has 3 scars, and goes to take a 4th, they are put into a state where they can no longer be an adventurer due to the physical or mental strain and the character must say it's goodbyes at the end of this game. How the character comes to its conclusion in the game can be decided between the player and the DM. Taking too many scars is not always equivalent to death. For example, they could become a retainer, go home to their family, take a quest that requires them to leave the party or become benched from their injuries and come back at a later date. As with any game, make sure to be compassionate in handling the end of a character's story.

## Removing Scars

The path to healing a scar will differ depending on the type of game you're running and the players you have. The most important thing about scars is making sure that you've set clear rules early and communicate expectations properly. Does your group want death to be a real possibility or do they just want to play their one character til the end? It is recommended that a DM considers the themes and tones of their world when considering how Scars should function. For example, in a survival horror game scars may not be healable at all as to further push the narrative that life in this world is scarce. In a dark fantasy, healing the scar may come at a great cost to further extend the notion that great power comes with great sacrifice. In a super hero game where heroes must always push forward no matter what, it may be better to instead allow scars to be healed easier.

**_Below are a few examples of how one may heal a scar:_**

-   Foregoing a major milestone to instead heal the scar
-   Spending a predetermined amount of BP to pay a doctor to heal it
-   Taking a quest that helps the character overcome their scar
-   Overcoming a major story point or defeating the villain who caused the scar
-   A time skip or major period of down time

Be careful when adjusting rules for Scars as it has the potential to influence the state of the game. If a player thinks they are fragile, they may play in a low risk, less exciting way. If they feel invincible, it can remove stakes and mess with the suspension of disbelief. It requires a balance.
