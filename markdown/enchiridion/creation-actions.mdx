# Creation Actions

These actions are used to modify the scene to increase the narrative permission of the players. These actions are critical for enabling players around obstacles, scouting enemies, disabling threatening effects and interacting with directive details and concepts. Be ready to ponder the inconceivable as these actions allow you to imagine your way out of problems.

<Callout emoji={'⏱️🪄'} heading="Some Expectations">
    <ul>
        <li>
            These actions come down to DM discretion in most instances. With
            that in mind, do not break the game on purpose. Do not Invent the
            end of the universe or insta-kill buttons unless they are
            narratively satisfying for everyone at the table.
        </li>
        <li>
            When you play one of these actions, options are potentially
            infinite. Have an idea of what you are going to do before you play
            your card. You will be expected to be creative and improvise.
        </li>
        <li>
            These potency of these actions will depend on the creativity of
            their use
        </li>
        <li>
            These actions won't always have an immediate pay off. While they
            require a bit of set up, when they start being used, they will
            define encounters
        </li>
    </ul>
</Callout>

## Interact

_Create, Modify or Remove any Detail in this Zone_
_REPEAT: You may Flip 1 to Create, Modify or Remove any Detail_
_THEN - You may utilise one of your gadgets_

### Details

Provides a strong narrative permission in a scene that does not have any in game mechanics associated with it. Used to justify the use of actions and skills in situations they wouldn't normally apply. Details grant +2 to Invent actions that involve the use of the Detail. When a detail gets used it is not burnt or locked.

<Callout emoji={'✨'} heading="Example Detail">
    My character cannot access the sky zone because they cannot fly. I Explore
    into the secret laboratory creating the Zone Detail "weird experiments." On
    my next turn, I Interact with the secret laboratory and invoke the "weird
    experiments" detail to create the Character Detail "Jetpack." It would be
    assumed my character can now fly, and therefore I can now access the sky
    zone.
</Callout>

### Character Detail

A character detail is a narrative permission that exists involving a character. When creating a character detail, a player may invoke their aspects, another detail or a concept in order to justify to the table that the action is viable. Examples of a Character Detail includes equipping an item, interacting with an effect that is currently affecting the character, or a character altering itself in some way that extends its narrative permission.

#### Example of Character Detail

<Callout emoji={'🆒'} heading="Get Access to New Things">
    I create the Character Detail "I have a jetpack" which narratively lets me
    fly. I can now access the Sky Zone.
</Callout>
<Callout emoji={'⏫'} heading="Enable Skills">
    This enemy has immunity to Shoot due to it's kevlar. I create the Character
    detail "I have a Rocket Launcher", I can Overcome this enemy with Shoot.
</Callout>
<Callout emoji={'🩸'} heading="Create Effects">
    My character is bleeding. They take one damage at the start of each of their
    turns.
</Callout>
<Callout emoji={'🧯'} heading="Maniplulate Zones">
    I am in the Bush Fire zone. I created the Character Concept "Hose". I am now
    able to modify the zone with Invent to remove the fire from the zone.
</Callout>

### Zone Detail

A zone detail is a narrative permission that exists involving a zone. When creating a zone detail, a player defines something within the zone that affects how it operates. This could include an object of significance, a potential hazard or a vivid description of the scenery.

#### Examples of Zone Details

-   **Item:** This zone has a computer terminal
-   **Potential Hazard:** This zone is on fire
-   **Defined Terrain:** This zone is on a hill
-   **Noteable Scene Influence:** This zone has a notable thing in it

### Scene Details - Invent Only

A Scene Detail is a narrative permission that exists involving the entire scene. These can only be created, modified or removed by the Invent action.

### Gadgets

Gadgets are a piece of equipment with an on-going effect. This can include vehicles, passive bonuses, summons, etc. Gadgets can be built with a minimum of 6BP.

<Callout emoji={'🕹️🧠'} heading="Things to remember">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Make sure to place a reminder for yourself somewhere that the effect
            is in play that yourself and the DM have easy access too
        </li>
        <li>
            Gadgets are powerful but slow. In big battles, make sure to use them
            efficiently. In quick battles, consider if they'll have an impact.
        </li>
    </ul>
</Callout>

## Invent

**When drawn, gain Lowest Priority.**
**THEN - Use an Invention Action (DC 13 - 2 per relevant Active Detail)**
**If your Invention fails, Refresh Self 1**

**Invention Actions**

-   Create a Scene Detail (Create a detail that affects all zones)
-   Remove a Scene Detail (Remove a detail that affects all zones)
-   Upgrade a Detail (Merge 2 or more details together to create a player concept)
-   Change a Concept (Modify a Concept that is already in play)
-   Drive a Story Point (Create a Concept in relation to a Characteristic)

### Invention Roll

The first step of making an Invention roll is to tell the story of what the player wishes their character to do. After that has been described, the player and DM should work together to properly decide which of the Invention actions best describes what the player is attempting. If the player is trying to bend the rules of the game, take a bit of extra time to consider the consequences for the encounter. The key rule with Inventions is that the player describes what happens and the DM defines the result in terms of game mechanics.

The base DC for any Invention roll is 13. This however can be modified in several ways:

-   **Active Details:** Active details relevant to the situation grant +2 to the roll
-   **Power Scaling:** The DC for any roll is designed to emulate the perceived difficulty of the task. In certain circumstances the DM may elect to raise the DC to balance the power of what the player is trying to do to the roll that should be required for it. For example If the character intends on doing something they'd find challenging, the player and DM have come to an agreement on a powerful resolution that requires a higher DC than normal or the Invention will have massive implications on the encounter.
-   **Rule of Cool:** When the character realistically shouldnt be able to but the DM wants to see what happens, they can choose to up the DC as a counterbalance.
-   **Dramatic Tension:** The DM may at any point up the DC of an Invention roll to add stakes to it. We recommend that DMs use this sparingly and only for critical moments.

**_The guidelines of an Invention are:_**

-   Inventions give extreme player control. With great power comes great responsibility.
-   The player describes the Invention, the DM details what it does. In particular, if a Concept is created that has a mechanical effect on the game, the DM decides what the rules of that Concept are. Players cannot insist that a DM should add a rule to a detail or concept
-   Inventions do not do damage to enemies. Enemies can take damage from concepts if the DM decides that they would within narrative permission.
-   A player cannot control an enemy's autonomy. This includes stunning, disarming, disfiguring or anything that renders an enemy incapacitated, trapped or unable to operate as per normal functioning. Characters should never be treated with a rocks fall and you die mentality, even enemies. If a player wishes to manipulate an enemy's autonomy, it may be best to discuss it with the DM before the card is placed into priority.
-   Under the circumstances where a player wishes to directly target a character with the intention of manipulating it's autonomy or health and the DM is comfortable with it, they require:
    -- A Detail that allows it to occur
    -- A story in progress where it is both dramatic and makes sense
    -- Express DM consent on a case by case basis.
-   If Invent is used in relation to modifying a Directive, rather than using an Invent action, it may be best to discuss with the group if they collectively wish to transition into a differing story point and change it at the start of a round. An example might be if a party is in a gun fight they cannot win and wish to retreat, rather than one of the players having to Invent the Scene Detail "The Party Flees", at the start of a round, the DM changes the Directive to the Flee directive.

### Invention Explanation

Below are examples of Invention actions and they may work in practice. The first example is a player Inventing in a situation with Fire details that is causing his party and the NPC they are with harm. The second example is a player Inventing in a situation with Light and Dark details affecting the vision of his party and their narrative permission. The third example is a player Inventing in a situation where a landslide concept has limited the party's movement.

#### Creating a Scene Detail

Creating a Scene Detail creates a Detail that exists anywhere it is applicable in the entire scene.

<SpeechDialogue title='"I light the building on fire."'>
    <Bubble emoji="🕺" talker="Player">
        I light the building on fire, create the scene detail "Burning".
        Everything in the scene is on fire.
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble right emoji="👑" talker="Game Master" color="teal.800">
        Excellent, all characters who end their turn in a "Burning zone" take 1
        damage.
    </Bubble>
</SpeechDialogue>

<SpeechDialogue title='"I turn out the lights."'>
    <Bubble emoji="🕺" talker="Player">
        I cut the power to the lights and create the Scene detail "Darkness
        Calls." The scene has a detail of darkness.
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble right emoji="👑" talker="Game Master" color="teal.800">
        Awesome! Characters cannot see unless another detail allows them to.
    </Bubble>
</SpeechDialogue>

<SpeechDialogue title='"I cause a landslide."'>
    <Bubble emoji="🕺" talker="Player">
        I the boulders down the mountainside and create the Scene detail
        "Landslide". The scene has difficult terrain.
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble right emoji="👑" talker="Game Master" color="teal.800">
        Hell Yeah! Characters must pass a DC 8 Athletics roll to leave this
        zone.
    </Bubble>
</SpeechDialogue>

#### Removing A Detail

Removing a Detail removes a Detail that exists anywhere it is applicable in the entire scene.

Remove a Detail from the scene
"I turn on the fire suppression system."
Player: I turn on the fire suppression system using my Fire Alarm detail with Inspect

DM: Roll Inspect. On a success, remove all details related to fire and burning from the scene
"I turn out the lights"
Player: I want to use my Might to destroy the power supply and turn out the lights.

DM: Roll Might. On a success, remove all details related to light from the scene
"I remove the difficult terrain with my bulldozer detail"
Player: I remove the difficult terrain with Pilot by utilising the bulldozer detail"

DM: Roll Pilot. On a success, remove Landslide detail. Players may now move through this scene normally.

#### Upgrade Details

When using an Upgrade action the player combines 2 or more details into a player concept. When creating this Upgrade, the player must describe how these two details combine and what benefit that brings to the players. Upon success, all details used in the creation process are burned and replaced with a concept. As with all Invention actions, the player describes the story of the Upgrade and the DM defines a rule for their Invention.

Upgrade
"I want to combine the Fire Extinguisher and Office Chair"
Player: I want to Upgrade the Fire Extinguisher and Office Chair details so I can drag this contraption around with me and put out fires. I want to Assemble this device.

DM: This is kind of crazy so I am going to increase the DC. However, this might work, roll Assemble. On a success, any tile you explore into will have the "Burning" detail removed.
"I want to upgrade the Torch and High Bookcase detail to create a spotlight"
Player: I want to Upgrade the Torch and the High Bookcase details to create a spotlight. To do this, I will use Inspect to find the right place to put it.

DM: This might work, roll Inspect. On a success, characters who share the zone with this detail are immune to all darkness based details and concepts. .
"I want to Upgrade the Bulldozer and Spiked Rocks detail to create a "Spiked Bulldozer"
Player: I want to Upgrade the Bulldozer and Spiked Rocks detail to create a "Death Machine." I will use my Guts to put this together to not be squeamish about the sheer violence I will cause.

DM: While not normally appropriate, that's hilarious, so I'll allow it. Roll Guts, on a success, for the rest of this game, if you succeed an Overcome while using Operate, succeed with style.

#### Changing a Concept

Changing a Concept allows players to modify a Concept that already exists within the game. The more absurd the removal of the concept or the bigger of a task it may be, the stricter the narrative permission becomes. The DM may even choose to raise the DC of the roll if they wish.

**_When creating a Change of Concept as a player; remember to consider:_**

-   Is this action made with the intent of telling a compelling story and do I believe it will achieve it?
-   Am I breaking the DM's game in a way that will not be enjoyable for all other players?
-   Does it make sense for my character to take this action in this circumstance?

**_As a DM, When allowing a Changing Concept roll to happen; remember to consider:_**

-   Is this fun?
-   Does this make sense?
-   Will this ruin the fun for the other players at the table?

**_As a DM, When denying a Changing Concept roll to happen; remember to consider:_**

-   Am I being self aware? Just because a player defeats the encounter does not make it unfair inherently.
-   Does denying this action prevent engaging storytelling?
-   Is there a way I can construct this with the player where we both get what we want? Compromise is always better than flat denial.

Changing A Concept
"I turn on the fire suppression system which nullifies the damage from the Burning Concept"
Changing a Concept comes with strict narrative permission that must be followed in order to adjust said premise.

Player: I want to Inspect a way for my fire suppression system to flood the enemies flamethrower and make them unable to use it.

DM: "Does this make sense in the story world without ruining the story?"

YES: That might work, roll Inspect. On a success, remove all details related to fire and burning from the scene

NO: That wouldn't work here. Here is another suggestion. If not, try something else.
"I change the concept of "Darkness Calls" to only affect those who do not have a light detail
Changing a Concept comes with strict narrative permission that must be followed in order to adjust said premise.

Player "I know that I cannot fix the darkness, but I would like to use my Protocol to turn my"Torch" detail into a beacon to make it so that those in the same zone as the torch do not have to roll against "Darkness Calls".

DM: "Does this make sense in the story world without ruining the story?"

YES: That might work, roll Protocol. On a success, those in the same zone as the torch are not affected by "Darkness Calls".

NO: That wouldn't work here. Here is another suggestion. If not, try something else.
"I wish to change the concept of "Landslide Terrain" to "Secret Tunnels."
Changing a Concept comes with strict narrative permission that must be followed in order to adjust a premise.

Player: I want to change the concept of Landslide Terrain to Secret Tunnels by using my Construct skill to create passageways that we can pass through.

DM: "Does this make sense in the story world without ruining the story?"

YES: That might work, roll Construct. On a success, Landslide Terrain is replaced with Secret Tunnels which reads "All players in a secret tunnel tile now roll Sneak at +2."

NO: That wouldn't work here. Here is another suggestion. If not, try something else.

#### Drive a Story Point

Driving a Story point is an action that allows the player to drive themselves into a clear narrative direction for the scene. Driving a Story Point does not mean "I want to win" or "I must survive", it relates to the character's Characteristics and the growth they wish to see from their character. A character could provoke an enemy into taking an action they otherwise wouldn't, direct NPCs or interact in a unique way with story premises. This Invention is to facilitate storytelling that results in a direct follow through of the themes of the game and characters. Driving a Story point can break other pre-built rules of the game (Inventions cannot target enemies) but they must drive the dramatic tensions of the scene further.

Drive a Story Point
"I order the crew to leave so they don't get caught in the fire"
Driving a Story Point comes with strict narrative permission that must be followed in order to adjust a premise.

Player: I want to command the civilians on the ship to escape by using my captainly Presence

DM: "Does this make sense in the story world without ruining the story?"

YES: That might work, roll Presence. On a success, the crew of NPC's evacuate the ship.

NO: That wouldn't work here. Here is another suggestion. If not, try something else.
"I will be the light through the darkness"
Driving a Story Point comes with strict narrative permission that must be followed in order to adjust a premise.

Player: I want to use my Torch detail to create a rallying beacon for the other players. I want the other players to be able to see me. I wish to use Alertness to spot characters in the dark and signal them.

DM: "Does this make sense in the story world without ruining the story?"

YES: That might work, roll Alertness. On a success, whichever zone your character in ignores the Darkness detail, however as the Concept "Darkness Calls" exists, enemies will also be able to use this concept and now see where you are.

NO: That wouldn't work here. Here is another suggestion. If not, try something else.
"I want to trap the enemy under the falling rocks so they can't leave this zone"
Driving a Story Point comes with strict narrative permission that must be followed in order to adjust a premise.

Player: I want to trap the enemy under the falling rocks so they can't leave this zone so I can give the innocent time to escape. This coincides with my aspect "Be Strong for the Weak", and so I will use my Might to cause a cave in.

DM: "Does this make sense in the story world without ruining the story?"

YES: This might work, roll Might. On a success, this enemy cannot leave this zone, but neither can you. No characters may enter or leave this zone until this concept is removed.

NO: That wouldn't work here. Here is another suggestion. If not, try something else.

## Sense

_Refresh Self_
_Examine_
_Create a Defect_

### Examine

Examine allows the user to either perceive the length of a chain or its vanquish.

Using Examine to scout enemies is important for:

-   Making sure links of overcome are not wasted
-   Choosing which Vanquish to tackle first
-   Getting a judge of the enemy's strength
-   Scouting for clues on how the enemy will operate

### Defect

A Defect is an Aspect that an enemy has that is to their detriment. A player may utilise a Defect to make an Aspect roll. Like all Aspects, Defects may also be locked for Momentum. Defects can be used to attack an enemy with their own weak points. If a player is having trouble attacking with their proficient skills a player can set up Defects in order to enable them to continue Overcoming. A strength of Defects is they are specifically not skills, they may be used to bypass immunities or pivot the enemy into having to defend using a different skill.

A Good Defect is:

-   Usable easily by any team member
-   Makes sense as either a kryptonite or simple weakness of the enemy
-   Does not trivialise story stakes by making the enemy seem dumb

<Callout emoji={'🤯'} heading="Example Defect">
    The team are fighting a Giant Robot with an impenetrable armour detail which
    makes it immune to Target. The scientist creates the Defect "Explosive
    Prone." On the Gunners turn, he is able to Overcome using Explosive Prone
    for a +5 due to his Rocket Launcher detail. This allows the Gunner to
    describe him shooting the Robot despite it being immune to Target. Due to
    the way The Gunner has worded his equipment, they are also able to use some
    of them as the story describes him "Shooting" the enemy, despite not using
    Target.
