# Character Progression

Leveling up in Omen can happen in a variety of ways, here a few.

## Loot

Loot is the rewards the players receive as games are played. This is often represented in plunder taken off of enemies, friends made, equipment created and the other destinies manifested as part of the journey. The DM decides which Loot you achieve based on what form of milestone you have overcome in your session.

## Milestones

Minor Milestone: Finish a Game - Gain a Build Point
Moderate Milestone: Defeat a Boss/Complete a Story Point - Gain a looted item
Major Milestone: Complete a Major Story Arc. - Gain a Major Reward

A "Build Point" can be spent to build equipment or create an enhancement for your character. A looted item is a piece of equipment you grab off on an enemy that can be used by a player or broken down into half of its original build point cost (determined by DM). A Major Reward is a powerful bonus that only the DM can grant. To achieve one of these the party must achieve something spectacular.

## Upgrade Layout

A player starts the game with upgrade slots equal to the Power of the game. Most loot, especially more powerful loot, will need to be equipped into an upgrade slot to use. The player can only have loot equipped equal to the amount of upgrade slots that they have available. DM's may choose to incentivise players leaving upgrade slots open with rewards. For example, free concepts, free advantages, turning omen tokens light.

## Home Base

In order to spend build points and create equipment, a player must return to a home base. Somewhere the character feels safe and can spend great amounts of time working on something without being interrupted. This can range from a ship, hideout or campsite depending on the setting. At their home base they are able to spend their points, break down items or re-arrange their current equipment layout. With DM permission, a player may also change their skill choices, consequences and aspects. Equipment being created must fall within the verisimilitude of the world. That means following the Cost tiers and Cost Factors determined by the DM. Loot that is broken down into its core parts gains points equal to half its build point value (rounded up).
