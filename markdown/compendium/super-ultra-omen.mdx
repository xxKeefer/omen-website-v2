# Super Ultra Omen

Super Ultra Omen _(SUO)_ is a variant of the standard rules of the game designed to let you tell stories about super heroes. I features some tweaks to the rules including the Profession Aspect, the Overcome and Encourage cards, how health works and finally introducing a new mechanic: the Super Ultra omen token.

## Omens as Health

In SUO, omens are used to represent health in stead of the standard consequence boxes. Additionally characters start with ten omen tokens. When a character is damaged, they lose omen tokens equal to the amount of sustained damage. SUO also defines a set of states that a character can be in based on there current amount of omens. These states, called **_SITUATIONS_** are as follows:

-   **Heroic** - All of a character's omens tokens are light.
-   **Fine** - Half or more of a character's omen tokens are light.
-   **Hurt** - Half or more of a character's omen tokens are dark.
-   **Dire** - All of a character's omens tokens are dark.

## Super Powers

in SUO, the Profession aspect is replaced with the Super Power aspect. You may call this whatever you like but it represents the character's super powers. This aspect in addition to it's normal rules for things like aspect actions, acts like a character specific premise that allows them to use their skills in ways not usually possible as long as it makes sens in the context of the super power.

## Overcome Errata

Using the OVERCOME card is the primary way to defeat the challenges during combat. OVERCOME is a very versatile card. If you are in the same Zone you can try and succeed in a skill challenge to close chains. If you aren't close enough you can FLIP to move a zone before the skill challenge.

Super Ultra Omen extends these rules so you can keep your distance from threats if you want to trade damage for safety and do little less damage but from range. It does this by introducing the concept of a **Melee** and **Ranged** Overcome.

### Melee

Melee OVERCOMES are those that happen in the same zone as the target of the skill challenge. These OVERCOMES close two chains and an additional chain if you succeed with style.

### Ranged

If you don't want to get up close, you can also OVERCOME targets that are in ADJACENT Zones by doing a Ranged OVERCOME. These OVERCOMES close one chain and an additional chain if you succeed with style.

## Encourage Errata

Because in SUO characters have double the amount of omens because they also represent their health it skews the difficulty of succeeding an UNLOCK roll. so the UNLOCK roll DC has been adjusted to the following:

-   On an ally, the DC is equal to **3+** the number of light tokens of the target
-   On an enemy, the DC is equal to **3+** the number of light tokens of the user

## Going Super Ultra

Super Ultra Omen introduces an additional mechanic to the game called **Super Ultra**. Super Ultra is a new special omen token separate from Flip cost and the Health system. It begins in a light state at the start of every game and there is no way to refresh it meaning it can only be used once. To activate Super Ultra the character must be in a Hurt Situation or worse, once activated the following happens:

-   For three turns, at the beginning of your turn Refresh 1 and Recover 1.
-   While active, a player rolls all skills with advantage.
-   All utilized Aspects Actions become usable again.
-   If the player uses an Aspect Action while Plus Ultra, they Recover 1.
-   If you are still Hurt at the end of your Plus Ultra, Recover 2.
-   If you are Heroic at the end of your Plus Ultra, also create an advantage.
