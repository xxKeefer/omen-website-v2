### Overcoming Enemies and Challenges

When combat begins, the DM and players agree on the conditions of victory. The DM assigns chains equal to the challenge rating of the encounter, and the party must go about overcoming them.

When using an overcome action, for a challenge, the player elects what they wish to do, and what skill they wish to use. The DM deems whether the skill is appropriate and sets a DC based on the likelihood of the action and the appropriateness of the skill. Ie When lifting something a player trying to use Athletics may have a higher DC then someone using Might. When using an overcome action against an enemy the player will select how they are overcoming them and with what skill, and the enemy will select an appropriate skill to defend with, and the one with the highest roll succeeds. A tie means nothing occurs. If a player succeeds by more than double, they have "Succeeded with Style", allowing them to close two chains at once.

### Chains/Combos

Any given encounter may have multiple chains of multiple ranks. A chain's rank determines how many successful overcome actions it takes to break the chain. To defeat a higher rank chain, players will be required to combo their overcomes off of each other. One success creates a one hit combo. Once a combo is established, the next player using an overcome may choose to create a new hit combo or continue on the original. There is no limit on the amount of combos that can be active at one time. If continuing a combo, a player must act in a way to feed off the first action. For example: Player 1 grabs the enemies leg, Player 2 trips them over. To defeat a high rank chain, a combo must be continued to the rank it is and then closed. When attempting to create a large combo, players should make sure to use actions that another player can easily imagine a continued overcome.

### Closing a Combo

When completing an overcome action a player will be given an option to close the combo or leave it open. If open, the next player can continue the combo. If closed, the highest rank chain equal to or lower then the combo being closed will be selected. For example, if the enemy has a rank 4 and a rank 2 chain, and player 1 closes a combo with 3 ranks, it will close the rank 2 chain. Using actions such as identify will assist in determining how many chains you require to combo to defeat an enemy. When enemies have chains closed on them, they are closer to defeat, but also may gain or lose abilities, so make sure to watch their behaviour.
