# Overcome

When Overcoming, this character makes an effort to achieve victory within the context of the scene. This character overcomes the situation. It is about doing what is required to win. Even in combat, that does not mean that you have to deal damage or attack someone. The best ways to achieve success in Omen are often the most creative. The enemy in any scene may not necessarily be an attackable entity. An encounter could be based on literally anything, so make sure in character creation to diversify your skill list. Common non-combat encounters could include rescue, escape, conversation, performing a task, staying hidden, stealing or an amalgamation of many at once.

Make sure to allow flexibility in your thinking when figuring out how to defeat an enemy. An example could be a detective character who can't quite Target a Speedy character. They could instead Overcome with Inspect by detecting predictable patterns in their movement. Depending on DM ruling, this character may not be able to defend with Speed against this as they will still act in the same pattern, forcing them to defend with other skills. This benefits the detective character by forcing the Speedy enemy off of their primary skill.

Any skill can potentially be used to defeat an enemy. Omen's key rule is that if it makes sense in the scenario, then it's possible. If you're planning on using a skill that is obscure, make sure that there is context to it. For example, a doctor may want to attack with Anatomy. In this example, it could be explained as "My doctor knows exactly where to hit him so he does not require much force." While against a grunt that may work, but what about an enemy that is super fast? This enemy likely defends with Speed, so force has very little to do with it. If these contexts don't appear often in game, there is always the option of creating concepts that allow your character to attack with that skill or spending BP for attachments that allow you to attack with that skill.

    Body Mass Index: When attacking enemies larger than them, players may use
    Anatomy.

<Callout emoji={'üîåüìé'} heading="Example Attachment">
    Body Mass Index: This character gains +2 Anatomy against unarmoured enemies.
    This character has narrative permission to Overcome with Anatomy against any
    unarmoured target that is bigger than them.

## Action

1. _Flip 1 to Move 1 to a Discovered Zone_
1. _Roll an Overcome Roll against an enemy in this zone_
1. _If you succeed, Create Momentum_

### Flip 1 to Move

This is required to be done before the Overcome. A Discovered Zone is a zone that is already revealed on the map.

### Overcome Roll

An Overcome roll is used to close chains. When overcoming, the first step is to choose which chain this character is attempting to overcome. Then, the player must describe how they wish to Overcome the situation and which skill they intend to use. Once the player has described the narrative of their Overcome, the DM describes how the enemy or encounter defends and which skill they are defending with. Both sides roll openly. After both sides have rolled, they may begin using Aspects and Momentum to manipulate the results. This is done simultaneously and the side with the highest total wins. Once both sides are done, the DM lets the player know if they succeeded. On a success, the player deals a link of damage to the chain they selected.

### Succeed With Style

If they succeed by more than double, then they "Succeed with Style." Succeeding with Style means the player deals an additional link of damage and may apply one of the following effects:

-   Create a Defect on the Enemy
-   Examine this Enemy
-   Refresh Any Player 1

### Building Momentum

Describe how your attempts to Overcome the situation have started generating Momentum for your team. In the context of Overcome this could include creating opportunities against an enemy, inspiring those around you, building confidence or gaining the upper hand on the situation. Remember that Momentum is intended to be used as a Team Resource, so the vaguer it is, generally the better. If you can't think of anything on the spot, don't stress and throw in the first thing to come to mind. Naming momentum is a fun flavour thing in most cases. Momentum is built incredibly often and carries no narrative permission, so just have fun with it.

### Overcoming Enemies and Challenges

When combat begins, the DM and players agree on the conditions of victory. The DM assigns chains equal to the challenge rating of the encounter, and the party must go about overcoming them.

When using an overcome action, for a challenge, the player elects what they wish to do, and what skill they wish to use. The DM deems whether the skill is appropriate and sets a DC based on the likelihood of the action and the appropriateness of the skill. Ie When lifting something a player trying to use Athletics may have a higher DC then someone using Might. When using an overcome action against an enemy the player will select how they are overcoming them and with what skill, and the enemy will select an appropriate skill to defend with, and the one with the highest roll succeeds. A tie means nothing occurs. If a player succeeds by more than double, they have "Succeeded with Style", allowing them to close two chains at once.

### Chains/Combos

Any given encounter may have multiple chains of multiple ranks. A chain's rank determines how many successful overcome actions it takes to break the chain. To defeat a higher rank chain, players will be required to combo their overcomes off of each other. One success creates a one hit combo. Once a combo is established, the next player using an overcome may choose to create a new hit combo or continue on the original. There is no limit on the amount of combos that can be active at one time. If continuing a combo, a player must act in a way to feed off the first action. For example: Player 1 grabs the enemies leg, Player 2 trips them over. To defeat a high rank chain, a combo must be continued to the rank it is and then closed. When attempting to create a large combo, players should make sure to use actions that another player can easily imagine a continued overcome.

### Closing a Combo

When completing an overcome action a player will be given an option to close the combo or leave it open. If open, the next player can continue the combo. If closed, the highest rank chain equal to or lower then the combo being closed will be selected. For example, if the enemy has a rank 4 and a rank 2 chain, and player 1 closes a combo with 3 ranks, it will close the rank 2 chain. Using actions such as identify will assist in determining how many chains you require to combo to defeat an enemy. When enemies have chains closed on them, they are closer to defeat, but also may gain or lose abilities, so make sure to watch their behaviour.
