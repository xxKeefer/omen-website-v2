# Traits

## Types of Traits

### Aspects

A minor narrative permission linked to a character. These may be locked either for an Aspect roll or Momentum.

_Aspects were previously known as "Character Aspects" in version 2.8_

### Defect

A defect is a temporary aspect that a player may place on an enemy using the Sense action. This defect can be locked by a player for an Aspect or Momentum roll.

Sense now allows players to give enemies Aspects they can lock to use Aspect Rolls against them.

### Scar

A scar is a permanent aspect on a player. Enemies may lock a player's Scar to make an Aspect or Momentum Roll.

#### Lock/Unlock (Key Word)

A player may Lock an Aspect before any roll to use the narrative permission of the aspect to explain the action with a modifier of +5. When any form of Aspect is locked, its narrative permission is still active however it cannot be used for an Aspect Roll or Momentum until it is unlocked.

Characteristics and Defects can be unlocked by doing an Unlock Roll which is an option on the Encourage Action card.

## Aspects

At the start of the game, the DM will decide 3-5 categories that the players will have as aspects. An aspect is a short catchy phrase that describes the character. These aspects should be used to develop the character, but also kept vague so they may be more easily used for Omens.

<Callout emoji="✨" heading="Bob the Bountyhunter">
    For Example, a character <em>Bob The Bountyhunter</em> might have the
    following aspect. <strong>Goal: That One that Got Away.</strong>
</Callout>

In a game session each aspect can only be tagged once. **BEFORE** making a roll for a skill check, a player may instead Flip 1 to forego electing a skill to tag an aspect. This _"Aspect Roll"_ will be at +5. If a player wishes to tag an aspect **AFTER** a roll has been made, it will grant a +2 or a re-roll.

<Callout emoji="✨" heading="Aspect Rolls">
    For example: "I don't have a good roll to defend against Technology. So
    instead, I will tag that I am an <strong>'Eccentric Maniac'</strong> that is
    impossible to predict and roll with a +5.
</Callout>
