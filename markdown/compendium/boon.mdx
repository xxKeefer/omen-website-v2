# Boon

**Boon Reminders:**

-   Most boons are one use, so be careful when using them.
-   You lose your Boon when you take a Scar. Make sure to throw it out if you're running out of consequences.
-   A good Boon is one that is designed around the identity of your character, so when describing it, make sure to use it in the most "in character" way. As they are quite powerful, make these moments matter in the story. PANACHE!

## Action

-   Your character's special ability.
-   Once this is played, do not retrieve it.

## Keywords

-   Will contain its own set of rules.

    Explaining things is hard, so we're working on it. Boons are particularly
    hard to explain because they are bespoke to individual characters. More on
    this soon.
