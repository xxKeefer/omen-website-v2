# Invent

**When drawn, gain Lowest Priority.**
**THEN - Use an Invention Action (DC 13 - 2 per relevant Active Detail)**
**If your Invention fails, Refresh Self 1**

**Invention Actions**

-   Create a Scene Detail (Create a detail that affects all zones)
-   Remove a Scene Detail (Remove a detail that affects all zones)
-   Upgrade a Detail (Merge 2 or more details together to create a player concept)
-   Change a Concept (Modify a Concept that is already in play)
-   Drive a Story Point (Create a Concept in relation to a Characteristic)

## Invention Roll

The first step of making an Invention roll is to tell the story of what the player wishes their character to do. After that has been described, the player and DM should work together to properly decide which of the Invention actions best describes what the player is attempting. If the player is trying to bend the rules of the game, take a bit of extra time to consider the consequences for the encounter. The key rule with Inventions is that the player describes what happens and the DM defines the result in terms of game mechanics.

The base DC for any Invention roll is 13. This however can be modified in several ways:

-   **Active Details:** Active details relevant to the situation grant +2 to the roll
-   **Power Scaling:** The DC for any roll is designed to emulate the perceived difficulty of the task. In certain circumstances the DM may elect to raise the DC to balance the power of what the player is trying to do to the roll that should be required for it. For example If the character intends on doing something they'd find challenging, the player and DM have come to an agreement on a powerful resolution that requires a higher DC than normal or the Invention will have massive implications on the encounter.
-   **Rule of Cool:** When the character realistically shouldn't be able to but the DM wants to see what happens, they can choose to up the DC as a counterbalance.
-   **Dramatic Tension:** The DM may at any point up the DC of an Invention roll to add stakes to it. We recommend that DMs use this sparingly and only for critical moments.

**_The guidelines of an Invention are:_**

-   Inventions give extreme player control. With great power comes great responsibility.
-   The player describes the Invention, the DM details what it does. In particular, if a Concept is created that has a mechanical effect on the game, the DM decides what the rules of that Concept are. Players cannot insist that a DM should add a rule to a detail or concept
-   Inventions do not do damage to enemies. Enemies can take damage from concepts if the DM decides that they would within narrative permission.
-   A player cannot control an enemy's autonomy. This includes stunning, disarming, disfiguring or anything that renders an enemy incapacitated, trapped or unable to operate as per normal functioning. Characters should never be treated with a rocks fall and you die mentality, even enemies. If a player wishes to manipulate an enemy's autonomy, it may be best to discuss it with the DM before the card is placed into priority.
-   Under the circumstances where a player wishes to directly target a character with the intention of manipulating it's autonomy or health and the DM is comfortable with it, they require:
    -- A Detail that allows it to occur
    -- A story in progress where it is both dramatic and makes sense
    -- Express DM consent on a case by case basis.
-   If Invent is used in relation to modifying a Directive, rather than using an Invent action, it may be best to discuss with the group if they collectively wish to transition into a differing story point and change it at the start of a round. An example might be if a party is in a gun fight they cannot win and wish to retreat, rather than one of the players having to Invent the Scene Detail "The Party Flees", at the start of a round, the DM changes the Directive to the Flee directive.

## Invention Explanation

Below are examples of Invention actions and they may work in practice. The first example is a player Inventing in a situation with Fire details that is causing his party and the NPC they are with harm. The second example is a player Inventing in a situation with Light and Dark details affecting the vision of his party and their narrative permission. The third example is a player Inventing in a situation where a landslide concept has limited the party's movement.

### Creating a Scene Detail

Creating a Scene Detail creates a Detail that exists anywhere it is applicable in the entire scene.

<SpeechDialogue title='"I light the building on fire."'>
    <Bubble emoji="ðŸ•º" talker="Player">
        I light the building on fire, create the scene detail "Burning".
        Everything in the scene is on fire.
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble right emoji="ðŸ‘‘" talker="Story Teller" color="teal.800">
        Excellent, all characters who end their turn in a "Burning zone" take 1
        damage.
    </Bubble>
</SpeechDialogue>

<SpeechDialogue title='"I turn out the lights."'>
    <Bubble emoji="ðŸ•º" talker="Player">
        I cut the power to the lights and create the Scene detail "Darkness
        Calls." The scene has a detail of darkness.
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble right emoji="ðŸ‘‘" talker="Story Teller" color="teal.800">
        Awesome! Characters cannot see unless another detail allows them to.
    </Bubble>
</SpeechDialogue>

<SpeechDialogue title='"I cause a landslide."'>
    <Bubble emoji="ðŸ•º" talker="Player">
        I push the boulders down the mountainside and create the Scene detail
        "Landslide". The scene has difficult terrain.
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble right emoji="ðŸ‘‘" talker="Story Teller" color="teal.800">
        Hell Yeah! Characters must pass a DC 8 Athletics roll to leave this
        zone.
    </Bubble>
</SpeechDialogue>

### Removing A Detail

Removing a Detail removes a Detail that exists anywhere it is applicable in the entire scene.

<SpeechDialogue title='"I activate the fire suppression system."'>
    <Bubble emoji="ðŸ•º" talker="Player">
        I turn on the fire suppression system using my Fire Alarm detail with
        Inspect
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble right emoji="ðŸ‘‘" talker="Story Teller" color="teal.800">
        Sweet, roll for Inspect. On a success, remove all details related to
        fire and burning from the scene.
    </Bubble>
</SpeechDialogue>

<SpeechDialogue title='"I power on the flood lights."'>
    <Bubble emoji="ðŸ•º" talker="Player">
        I want to use Specialty to hack into the lighting system and power on
        the flood lights.
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble right emoji="ðŸ‘‘" talker="Story Teller" color="teal.800">
        Cool, roll for Specialty. On a success, you turn on the lights and
        remove all details related to darkness from the scene.
    </Bubble>
</SpeechDialogue>

<SpeechDialogue title='"I flatten the ground with my bulldozer."'>
    <Bubble emoji="ðŸ•º" talker="Player">
        I jump into the quarry's bulldozer and flatten the ground with Operate a
        remove the difficult terrain.
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble right emoji="ðŸ‘‘" talker="Story Teller" color="teal.800">
        Yeah, definitely! You know how to pilot machinery, roll for Operate and
        on a success you remove the Landslide detail. With the Landslide gone,
        characters may move through this scene normally.
    </Bubble>
</SpeechDialogue>

### Upgrade Details

When using an Upgrade action the player combines two or more details into a player concept. When creating this Upgrade, the player must describe how these two details combine and what benefit that brings to the players. Upon success, all details used in the creation process are burned and replaced with a concept. As with all Invention actions, the player describes the story of the Upgrade and the DM defines a rule for their Invention.

<SpeechDialogue title='"I want to combine the Fire Extinguisher and Office Chair."'>
    <Bubble emoji="ðŸ•º" talker="Player">
        I want to Upgrade the Fire Extinguisher and Office Chair details so I
        can drag this contraption around with me and put out fires. I want to
        Assemble this device.
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble right emoji="ðŸ‘‘" talker="Story Teller" color="teal.800">
        Ha, This is kind of crazy so I am going to increase the DC. However,
        this might work, roll Assemble. On a success, any tile you explore into
        will have the "Burning" detail removed.
    </Bubble>
</SpeechDialogue>

<SpeechDialogue title='"I want to upgrade the Torch and High Bookcase detail to create a spotlight."'>
    <Bubble emoji="ðŸ•º" talker="Player">
        I want to Upgrade the Torch and the High Bookcase details to create a
        spotlight. To do this, I will use Inspect to find the right place to put
        it.
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble right emoji="ðŸ‘‘" talker="Story Teller" color="teal.800">
        Hmm... OK it might work, roll Inspect. On a success, characters who
        share the zone with this detail are immune to all darkness based details
        and concepts
    </Bubble>
</SpeechDialogue>

<SpeechDialogue title='"I want to Upgrade the Bulldozer and Spiked Rocks detail to create a Spiked Bulldozer."'>
    <Bubble emoji="ðŸ•º" talker="Player">
        I want to Upgrade the Bulldozer and Spiked Rocks detail to create a
        "Death Machine." I will use my Guts to put this together to not be
        squeamish about the sheer violence I will cause.
    </Bubble>
    <Bubble right emoji="ðŸ‘‘" talker="Story Teller" color="teal.800">
        Hahaha! While not normally appropriate, that's hilarious, so I'll allow
        it. Roll Guts, on a success, for the rest of this game, if you succeed
        an Overcome while using Operate, succeed with style.
    </Bubble>
</SpeechDialogue>

### Changing a Concept

Changing a Concept allows players to modify a Concept that already exists within the game. The more absurd the removal of the concept or the bigger of a task it may be, the stricter the narrative permission becomes. The DM may even choose to raise the DC of the roll if they wish.

**_When creating a Change of Concept as a player; remember to consider:_**

-   Is this action made with the intent of telling a compelling story and do I believe it will achieve it?
-   Am I breaking the DM's game in a way that will not be enjoyable for all other players?
-   Does it make sense for my character to take this action in this circumstance?

**_As a DM, When allowing a Changing Concept roll to happen; remember to consider:_**

-   Is this fun?
-   Does this make sense?
-   Will this ruin the fun for the other players at the table?

**_As a DM, When denying a Changing Concept roll to happen; remember to consider:_**

-   Am I being self aware? Just because a player defeats the encounter does not make it unfair inherently.
-   Does denying this action prevent engaging storytelling?
-   Is there a way I can construct this with the player where we both get what we want? Compromise is always better than flat denial.

**Changing a Concept comes with strict narrative permission that must be followed in order to adjust said premise.**

<SpeechDialogue title='"I turn on the fire suppression system which nullifies the damage from the Burning Concept."'>
    <Bubble emoji="ðŸ•º" talker="Player">

### Drive a Story Point

Driving a Story point is an action that allows the player to drive themselves into a clear narrative direction for the scene. Driving a Story Point does not mean "I want to win" or "I must survive", it relates to the character's Characteristics and the growth they wish to see from their character. A character could provoke an enemy into taking an action they otherwise wouldn't, direct NPCs or interact in a unique way with story premises. This Invention is to facilitate storytelling that results in a direct follow through of the themes of the game and characters. Driving a Story point can break other pre-built rules of the game (Inventions cannot target enemies) but they must drive the dramatic tensions of the scene further.

**Driving a Story Point comes with strict narrative permission that must be followed in order to adjust a premise.**
