# Zone Attributes

Zone attributes refer to all the descriptors you put on a card. At a bare minimum it can just be a name like "Sky","Underwater" or "Grassy Field", however Zones can have all sorts of attributes that can make each zone feel unique and have your players craving to EXPLORE into the next Zone.

## Zone Concepts and Rules

When every zone is a box with a name they can start to feel a bit bland, Omen already has a mechanic to make the story more interesting and nuanced: CONCEPTS. How can we apply CONCEPTS to Zones to make them more flavourful?

Firstly let's define Zone Concepts and Zone Rules. Zone Concepts function like normal Concepts with one key difference, Zone concepts only affect the Zone they are attached to. An example of a Zone Concept might be **_"The Kitchen is on FIRE!"_** This now defines some narrative permission in that zone. It's hot, you might get burnt, it might spread to other zones that can create all sorts of fun story beats mid game. This is just one example, but Zone concepts can be advantageous or a hindrance. The idea is to incentivise your players to work with or around the concept to create action and tension.

Now concepts are good because they are a puzzle that players can overcome or circumvent. However there are times you may not want to give the players those options and instead make the puzzle a challenge that they have to avoid or deal with. That's where Zone Rules come in, Zone Rules function exactly like Zone Concepts with one key difference: the players may not remove or alter them.

    <strong>Sky Zone:</strong>{' '}
    <em>
        "Falling - unless your character has some way or remaining airbourne,
        when you leave this zone you take one damage for every turn you were in
        the Sky Zone."
    </em>

Be careful how you implement this as it can limit some of the freedom Omen tries to create for players, however creativity is not born from infinite possibilities, it comes from defying expectations.

## Zone Advantages

Following a similar theme to Zone Concepts, Zone Advantages are Advantages that can only be utilized in a specific zone. If you find that you players think **EXPLORING** is not very exciting. You can spice this up by letting players create one or two Zone Advantages in the Zone they end their turn in after **EXPLORING**. This can throw the balance of the game quite severely in the favour of the players so this is an optional rule that you can use and tweak as you see fit.

# Zone Adjacency

The default mode for Omen is that two Zones are adjacent if one of their edges or corners are touching when aligned in a square grid.

<br />

| Symbol | Meaning                                     |
| :----: | :------------------------------------------ |
|   ❌   | CURRENT ZONE                                |
|   🟩   | ADJACENT ZONE                               |
|   🟧   | ADJACENT ZONE ONLY WITH NARATIVE PERMISSION |
|   ⬛   | NOT ADJACENT ZONE                           |

```txt
⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛
⬛🟩🟩🟩⬛
⬛🟩❌🟩⬛
⬛🟩🟩🟩⬛
⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛
```

However as discussed in the previous section, it can make sense sometimes to group Zones and say that they are all adjacent to each other regardless of how their edges/corners meet to convey a sense of closeness. Or you may want to restrict how players can move to make some abilities shine. For example, let's say the setting occurs in a thick jungle, the DM can decide that Zone Adjacency for the session is only Zones that share an edge on the grid unless your character has the ability to fly or narratively is a native tribesperson to the jungle.

<Callout emoji="✨" heading="The Speed Zone">
    In the superhero game we have been using as an example, there is a super
    speedster hero. For speedsters we include a a <em>Speed Zone</em> that is
    considered to be adjacent to all zones on only Speedster type characters can
    enter to create the feeling that speedsters can move anywhere quickly.
