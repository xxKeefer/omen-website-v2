# TPKs (Total Party Kills)

In any good story, defeat is not the end, but merely the beginning. When a group goes down, the DM and players may agree to a new story beat that changes the **directive** of the mission to keep the story going. These are a few examples.

## Flee

All players become Blessed. All discovered and undiscovered zones become locked, meaning that a character cannot leave it without successfully using an Interact action in the room to help them escape. The players must unlock rooms equal to currently alive allies x 3 and make it to the exit in order to successfully flee. Each time an ally would take damage, they instead Flip 1. If a player becomes Cursed for any reason, they are left behind.

## Bribe

Everyone has a price. The DM may allow a social encounter to occur with the enemies who have defeated them. In this instance, depending on how bitter the rivalry between the two parties are, they may be able to come to an accord for their survival. This could mean taking on a mission, sacrificing build points, or taking on a new allegiance. If the allies and enemies are unable to come to terms, seeking another directive would be best.

## To The Death

This town just isnâ€™t big enough for the two of them. Restore all allies and enemies to standard health and omen layouts and start the encounter again. If an ally would take a scar, instead retire them. No other directive cannot be elected until one side is completely wiped out. Do not do this option unless the entire group is certain this is the right call, as this puts the entire campaign on the line. If they do choose this, it's on them.
