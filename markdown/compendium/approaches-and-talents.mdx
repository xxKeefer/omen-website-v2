# Approaches, Talents and Skills

## Approaches

Omen Defines it's skills by dividing them into skill groups called **APPROACHES**. These **APPROACHES** are as follows:

-   **HEROIC** - skills associated with raw physical power
-   **EXPERT** - skills associated with having to be trained to be good at
-   **CAREFUL** - skills associated with detection and observation
-   **BRILLIANT** - skills associated with knowledge or education
-   **SUAVE** - skills associated with social situations or empathy

The skills within the groups have then been further colour coded in respect to star signs. This update is aimed to help characters feel more diverse and unique while having more tools to tell relevant stories. To categorise these skills for both character identity and enemy targeting, new terms have been crafted. All skills adjacent to a box are considered an APPROACH. For example, if the DM asked the player to use a HEROIC APPROACH, they could use MIGHT, SPEED, GUTS, STRIKE or THREATEN.

Within an APPROACH there is a HEROIC, EXPERT, CAREFUL, BRILLIANT and SUAVE skill. For example, within the BRILLIANT approach there is the ANATOMY skill. ANATOMY belongs in the BRILLIANT approach because people need very specialised training to be a professional, think of doctors and surgeons. And it is the HEROIC based BRILLIANT skill as it has to do with the human body and repairing its physical form.

Another example is the THREATEN skill which is the SUAVE based skill within the HEROIC approach. This is because THREATEN is obviously a skill related to social situations and it is within the HEROIC approach because it is very easy to THREATEN someone if you have a raw physical power to threaten violence as a consequence.

If a DM wished to refer to a group of skills of that type regardless of whether they were in the HEROIC APPROACH, they would refer to them as TALENTS. For Example, if the DM asked the player to use a HEROIC TALENT, they could use MIGHT, ASSEMBLE, NIMBLE, ANATOMY, or RESOLVE.

### Summary

-   The word in the box is the name of the skill.
-   The Box a skill is adjacent to is the Approach.
-   The colour of the box a skill is listed in is the Talent.

## Skill Proficiencies

At creation, characters will typically have seven proficiency points to assign to seven skills. A character with proficiency in a skill gains +3 in that skill. If a player still wishes to hit rank 5 with a skill, they can purchase an attachment with BP that will allow them to reach rank 5 in an intended circumstance. Additional proficiencies will be able to be crafted for BP. The bonus that a skill proficiency gives will only be upgradable by a Major Milestone.

        In most RPGs, there is an issue of when a player's skill rank goes up,
        so does the monsters, which does nothing except create the illusion of
        progression. It appears that in the best interest of enjoyment and skill
        expression that power scaling should be limited to more creative
        measures such as building gadgets with complex narrative permissions,
        players being able to play into the attachments they create and skillful
        use of action economy. If the illusion of progress is seen through
        testing to be core to the experience than this will be changed.{' '}
