# Interact

_Create, Modify or Remove any Detail in this Zone_
_REPEAT: You may Flip 1 to Create, Modify or Remove any Detail_
_THEN - You may utilise one of your gadgets_

## Details

Provides a strong narrative permission in a scene that does not have any in game mechanics associated with it. Used to justify the use of actions and skills in situations they wouldn't normally apply. Details grant +2 to Invent actions that involve the use of the Detail. When a detail gets used it is not burnt or locked.

<Callout emoji={'✨'} heading="Example Detail">
    My character cannot access the sky zone because they cannot fly. I Explore
    into the secret laboratory creating the Zone Detail "weird experiments." On
    my next turn, I Interact with the secret laboratory and invoke the "weird
    experiments" detail to create the Character Detail "Jetpack." It would be
    assumed my character can now fly, and therefore I can now access the sky
    zone.
</Callout>

## Character Detail

A character detail is a narrative permission that exists involving a character. When creating a character detail, a player may invoke their aspects, another detail or a concept in order to justify to the table that the action is viable. Examples of a Character Detail includes equipping an item, interacting with an effect that is currently affecting the character, or a character altering itself in some way that extends its narrative permission.

## Zone Detail

-   **Potential Hazard:** This zone is on fire
-   **Defined Terrain:** This zone is on a hill
-   **Noteable Scene Influence:** This zone has a notable thing in it

## Scene Details - Invent Only

A Scene Detail is a narrative permission that exists involving the entire scene. These can only be created, modified or removed by the Invent action.

## Gadgets

Gadgets are a piece of equipment with an on-going effect. This can include vehicles, passive bonuses, summons, etc. Gadgets can be built with a minimum of 6BP.

<Callout emoji={'🕹️🧠'} heading="Things to remember">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Make sure to place a reminder for yourself somewhere that the effect
            is in play that yourself and the DM have easy access too
        </li>
        <li>
            Gadgets are powerful but slow. In big battles, make sure to use them
            efficiently. In quick battles, consider if they'll have an impact.
