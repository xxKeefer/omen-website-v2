# Starting Layout

## Name

**Name**: “You got a name, punk?”

## Power

Power is the power level of the game. The power level of the game ranges between 3-10. The power level a standard starting character was designed for is 5. Be careful when straying outside of that variant.

## Omens

-   Each character gets one star sign at character creation
-   Total Omen tokens = Power (unless star sign determines otherwise)
-   Omen tokens may be earned in game via Major Milestones.

## Consequences

-   Level of consequence
    -   Creation: Power -1
    -   Build: Power
-   Amount of Consequences of each tier
    -   Creation: Power -1
    -   Build: Power
-   A player receives Power (x2) worth of boxes at character creation. Boxes are purchased at 1 Point = 1 Box.
-   A character may only ever have 3 scars, regardless of power.

## Equipment

-   1 piece of starting equipment at character creation. May take up an upgrade slot.

## Skills

-   (Power - 2) x10 skills.
-   Skills cap at 5 regardless of power level.
-   At character creation, a player may only have one skill at 5.

## Actions

-   One of each card is necessary for the full experience
-   One Boon is recommended at character creation but is a bendable rule for high power games. It is recommended to give players time to understand their character’s base before overloading them with abilities.
