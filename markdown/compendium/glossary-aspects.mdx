# Aspects

-   **Aspects:** A phrase that describes the character that is used to develop them but vague enough that they can be easier to use for Omens.
-   **Aspect Actions:** Before rolling, Flip 1 to replace a skill with an aspect which grants +5. After rolling, Flip 1 to gain an advantage on the roll. After using, lock the Aspect.
-   **Locked and Unlocked Aspects:** An unlocked aspect can be tagged to use an Aspect Action. When it is tagged, it becomes locked, and cannot be used again until it becomes unlocked. Aspects are unlocked via Encourage: Invoke.
