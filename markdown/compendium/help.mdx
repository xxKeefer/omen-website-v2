# Help

1. _Gain Highest Priority_
1. _You may Flip 1 to move any player who has not acted to any priority lower than yours._
1. _Refresh any player other than yourself._
1. _Create Momentum_

## Priority Manipulation

The idea behind Help is to set up your ally for a mega turn. By going first you are able to set up any resources your ally may need and letting them go before any of their enemies. This allows the player to get off their super turn before anything else can get in the way.

**Remember**

-   Help may conflict with other cards that give Highest priority. As with all cards, but especially this one, coordinate with your team.
-   Help goes really well with cards that have Lowest Priority
-   Help, along with Encourage, dish out a serious amount of resources. Momentum and Refresh together can lead to players getting very strong turns. If not, it is always helpful. If you are unsure on how to be helpful in your turn, throwing this card is always helpful.

## Pushing Back From Defeat

Help is very helpful for pushing the team back from a lack of resources. When the party has burnt through all of their momentum and refresh, a few turns of Help actions can put the party back on track to fighting back. Omen has an element of resource management and by allowing the party to regain their resources can push them from being beaten to beating the enemy.

<Callout emoji={'âœ¨'} heading="Example Help Scenario">
    The team is having trouble with an enemy as they are out of re-rolls. The
    Scientist uses Help which gives The Gunner a Refresh and builds Momentum. On
    The Gunners turn, they Overcome and attack an enemy. Due to the momentum The
    Scientist created, the Gunner succeeds, which allows The Gunner to create
    more Momentum. With the refresh, The Gunner is also able to use his Trinket
    for more value.
