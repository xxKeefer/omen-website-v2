# Encourage

1. _Refresh Any Player 1_
1. _EITHER- Roll to Unlock another player's Aspect. If you succeed, Refresh Target 1_
1. _OR - Roll to Unlock any Defect. If you succeed, Refresh Self 1_

## Unlock Roll

To unlock a Trait, the player must describe the Trait that they wish to unlock, how their character unlocks it and which skill they intend on using to do so. They then make a skill roll to determine whether they were successful. The DC is dependant on whether it is an enemy or ally:

-   On an ally, the DC is equal to 6+ the number of light tokens of the target
-   On an enemy, the DC is equal to 6+ the number of light tokens of the user

            Encouragement is best saved until resources have been spent to use.
            The DCs are lower, there is more likely to be things to unlock and
            the value will go further when you are lower on resources. Just like
            in the movies, when things get the most dire is when the heroes need
            their confidence restores

            Encourage's resources can be split amongst your whole party. You do
            not need to pile everything into one character.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any skill is able to Encourage as long as it makes sense to the
            Aspect that is being tagged. What is most important is building
            bonds between the two characters. Encourage is an excellent chance
            to roleplay two characters becoming closer.

            As a guideline, anything that would get an emotional reaction out of
            the character constitutes guidelines for encouragement. That could
            mean anything from something emotional to something funny depending
            on the type of game your table is running. Don't overthink the roll
            too much unless it's obviously a stretch or someone trying to
            justify using a skill they're better at. Story first.
        </li>
        <li>
            When unlocking Defects, the narrative is more focused on encouraging
            allies to continue fighting against a particular weak point on an
            enemy. "Hit them here", "I've found a gap", "That won't work, try
            this!"
        </li>
        <li>
            The DC for an Unlock action could change between when you play your
            card and when it is resolved. Make sure to coordinate with your team
            to keep the DC within reasonable chance of success.
