# Zones

Zones are the playground of action scenes in Omen. They are the media that expresses landmarks, unique features and distance on the game board. Zones at a bare minimum can be represented by boxes drawn on paper, this document will provide some tips and tricks to get the most story and action out of your zones.

# Preferred way to represent Zones

As mentioned previously at a bare minimum you can represent zones as boxes drawn on paper with notes written on them to describe the area. But if you really want to bring your players in and quickly communicate the context of the Zone, a picture is worth a thousand words.

Art cards are the best way to represent zones because it does two things. Firstly it is more visually interesting and immersive and secondly, it prompts the players imagination when it comes to creating components, concepts and describing their actions in a story driven way.

Let's have an example, the scenario is you're playing a campaign about spies and secret agents. The players have to infiltrate the Corrupt Warlord's Mega Casino. They have been told that their way in is through the marina. They are going in underwater because in various locations around the casino they have aquariums that connect to the ocean to let natural sea life float around. All is going well until they come face to face with underwater scuba guards!

Now let's consider the zones, first let's draw them as rectangles and write a description on top. This first Zone we'll call "Underwater". That's fine, we've described the scene and the ame can be played. But what if we use the following image?

<BillBoard
    src="/zones/ocean-scene.png"
    alt="ocean scene"
    width={512}
    height={288}
/>

Now we can see that there is long seaweed and coral, maybe the players use it to hide in or maybe strangle
the guard with the seaweed? Or what about this picture?

<BillBoard src="/zones/sharks.png" alt="sharks" width={512} height={295} />

Now there are sharks! What does that lead to? But the point is that writing these things on the card
just doesn't have as much impact. Or perhaps it's better to say while writing a description onto a rectangle
is good for being clear and direct with your narrative permission, but having a picture allows the players
to infer and think creatively themselves rather than being spoon fed a plot hook, and this can lead to
players surprising and delighting the DM.
