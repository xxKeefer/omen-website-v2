# Adapt

1. _After Priority is revealed, you may Flip 1 to Gain Highest Priority_
1. _Choose a Character in the Current Zone_
1. _THEN EITHER - They become IMMUNE, OBSTRUCTED OR VULNERABLE_
1. _ACTIVE 1_

## Highest Priority/Active

The card's effect remains active from when the card is played until the end of the round which it is played in. This means that players cannot set up a condition for themselves to use, and must rely on a teammate to follow up. Adapt is retrieved as per any other card at the end of the round. It is important for Adapt to act before the action that enables its intended effect to work. For example, if you wish to make a player immune, make sure that your turn happens before the enemies attack the character you're protecting, or the Adapt has been wasted. If you plan on using Adapt, make sure to have that Light Token available otherwise you run the risk of your action not assisting your team mate.

## Immune

**_Elect a Skill. One ally becomes immune to attacks using this skill._** Immune is best used to block big attacks from a boss (such as a routine ultimate) or to fend off waves of enemies using the same skill. For example if The Scientist is surrounded by hordes of Bandit Marksmen, making them immune to Target could help them considerably.

## Obstructed

**_Elect a Skill. An enemy's skill bonus for defending with this skill becomes 0._** Obstructed is best used to create an opening in an enemies defence. If the team finds that a unit is repetitively defending with the same skill and your team is unable to get past it, then Obstructed may be a way to force some Overcomes past it. Be careful when using Obstructed repetitively. DMs are advised to play into Adapt actions when narrative provides, however if you keep using the same trick, eventually the enemy will learn and begin defending with another skill.

## Vulnerable

**_Elect a skill. When an ally applies damage with that skill, they Succeed with Style._** Vulnerable is used to chain Succeed with Styles. This is a condition best used with the intention of the party bursting the enemy down.
