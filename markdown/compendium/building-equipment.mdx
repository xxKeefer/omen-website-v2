# Building Equipment (Factors, Conditions and Costs)

Some equipment will just be a case of a player and DM sitting down and designing the equipment and spending the build points required to make it. Other times there maybe some sort of story milestone or narative permission required before a peice of equipment can be made. If a dice roll, social encounter, or any other kind of related check is required for a piece of equipment, it can only be made during down time in a **_"Home Base."_** A roll of this nature can only be made once per game unless the DM allocates time for the players to actively work on their equipment.

This item must be
Approved by the DM
Abide by the verisimilitude of the world
The character must meet the Condition, Cost and Factor requirements
To create gear,
Determine the desired effect
Determine what type of gear that best meets
DM determines the value by totalling requirements when applicable. Base Cost + Factors + Conditions + Cost = Total Build Points Required.
Character goes to their 'Home Base' and creates the item.

## Factors

A factor is something within the game world that would delay a character from being able to use a piece of equipment. These are examples of the factors the DM may implement before a player may be able to create their equipment
Time
Component Ingredient: A piece of equipment may need a certain component to help build or use it.
Milestone: You must complete a quest or a certain type of milestone before you are able to use/build it
Attunement: You must spend time with the equipment before being able to operate it properly
Other: The DM can impose whatever restrictions they feel fits the situation.

## Conditions

A condition is a series of checks that need to be met in order to create the piece of equipment. These conditions can be added to a piece of equipment that could be particularly hard to obtain. Here are some examples.

##### Black Market

_You can only get that on the Black Market..._

-   A relevant contact roll to purchase or
-   A relevant Knowledge or Craft skill of 3 or higher or
-   Sneak or Burglary skill of 5 to build.

## Cost

Cost is the material value of the piece of equipment. When designing equipment, think about how many games it would take for a player to afford it with the currency within the world. In this instance, look at Build Points as an interchangeable currency. Its a good idea to have a rough idea of what value a build point has as a currency within the DMs world. Is 1 point worth 10, 100, 1000, 10,000 credit? Up to the DM. When upgrading a component, follow the same rules as building one. <br />

| Type                 | Description                                                                                                               | Example                                         | Cost |

| Poor Man Purchase    | Something that any person with an income could reasonably afford.                                                         | Groceries, Game consoles, Books.                | 0BP  |
| Working Man Purchase | Something that a working man would have to work for a while to afford.                                                    | Jewelry, A cheap car, a rented home.            | 1BP  |
| Wealthy Man Purchase | Something that a wealthy man would have to work regularly to afford.                                                      | A basic home, a sports car, a small business.   | 3BP  |

## Equipment Types

### Components

An item that your character can use that does not have an ability attached to it. Remember with a component, that it does not have any special tricks, it just is an item the character can interact with. If this is something the character interacts with often, it may be worth considering upgrading it to make it more exciting to use.

Point Value = Cost Requirement. May incur Factors and Conditions.

### Attachment

A component item that grants +2 to a skill in a specific circumstance.
When building an attachment, make sure to keep the situation it applies to vague. If a character has an attachment that they can trigger all of the time, you've essentially given them a +2 to all of their rolls. The purpose of an attachment is for very specific circumstances a player may not be able to trigger all of the time.
Example Swiss Army Knife. Can produce tools from their fingers. +2 to burglary to get through doors.

Point Value: 2 points base. May incur Factors, Conditions and Cost. Requires an Upgrade slot.

### Relic

An item that gives a +1 to a certain skill. These can be handed out as loot but not created.

Point Value: 5BP.

### Trinket

A trinket is an interactive component that does not take an action to use. Trinkets can only be used once per game. When building a trinket, you want to build something that interacts with the game itself. Ways this could work include adjusting priority, allowing a skill to work when it otherwise shouldn't or creating a component with a vast array of functions. The most important things to prioritise when building a trinket is simplicity and speed. Trinkets need to be easy to understand and when used resolved fluidly. A trinket will read '"When X, the player can activate their trinket to do Y.'"
Example: Reflex Boost: Must be used before priority is declared. The character has the highest priority for this turn and the lowest of the subsequent one. This can be used once per game.

Point Value: 3 points base. May incur Factors, Conditions and Cost. Requires an Upgrade slot.

### Gadget

A component item that uses the Amend action to activate. This item creates a concept that affects the scene in a drastic way. This concept can allow a character to do something they otherwise normally wouldn't be able to or to add a new dynamic to the scene. What is distinct about gadgets compared to other pieces of equipment is they create an on-going effect. A gadget can come in many forms.

##### For example:

-   **Gear**: A gadget can be something a character is wearing that enables them to do something they otherwise wouldn't

<Callout emoji="🚀🥾" heading="Rocket Boots" color="pink.900">
    <strong>Jet Boots:</strong> Before turn active to gain flight for the turn (
    <em>once per combat</em>) or Amend the Concept Rocket boots and become able
    to fly.
</Callout>

-   **Summon**: A summon is a gadget that has its own actions. To use one of these actions, before having the turn, the player may Flip 1 to replace their current action with a Summon action.

<Callout emoji="🕹️🚀" heading="Ship Summon" color="pink.900">
    <strong>Remote Control:</strong> To Summon the ship, create the concept Ship
    Summon. <br />
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Ship Overcome 1:</strong> Single target. Intimidation vs
            Conviction. If the target succeeds, they become immune to further
            attempts.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Ship Overcome 2:</strong> May drive into objects or enemies.
            Move 1. Pilot Overcome.
        </li>
    </ul>
</Callout>

-   **Bonus**: A gadget can be something that simply creates a concept in the scene that grants certain characters a bonus to their roll in a certain circumstance.
    Example: Shield Generator: All allies in the same zone gain +2 to defend against Physical Skills.

<Callout emoji="🛡️🔋" heading="Shield Generator" color="pink.900">
    <strong>Shield Generator:</strong>All allies in the same zone gain +2 to
    defend against Physical Skills.
</Callout>

Gadgets are an unlimited pool of potential in terms of what can be made.

-   **Point Value**: 5 points base. Gadget costing should be based on the power of the item as there is a large amount of variance. Will incur Factors, Conditions and Cost. Requires an Upgrade slot.
