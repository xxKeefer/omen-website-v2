# Upgrade Options

## Upgrade Slots

A starting character only has Upgrade slots equal to the Power level of the game. To use most loot, you will need to equip it into an upgrade slot. Loot that is not equipped into an upgrade slot is consider to not be in use. New Upgrade slots can only be achieved via a Major Milestone.

## Aspects

New aspects can only be obtained from a Major Milestone. Aspects can be changed with DM permission whenever appropriate. Aspect changes are generally changed as a direct response to a narrative thread forcing a character to change. Aspects do not use upgrade slots. Example: The apathetic hero finds something to care about, and the "Apathetic Warrior For Hire" Aspect he had no longer applies.

## Omens

Add an Omen Token: Major Milestone. An added Omen token uses an Upgrade slot.
Dark -> Light: An omen array can be adjusted when visiting a Home Base unless a rule of the Star Sign says otherwise.

## Consequences

A character may have up to 5 boxes in any given tier of consequences. A player may reconfigure their consequence layout if they have DM permission, 0 boxes of damage and are at their home base. To build a box, it costs 5 build points and take an amount of time equal to the time it would take to heal in order to create.

-   Minor (1 HP): Heals after combat.
-   Moderate (2 HP): Heals after a rest.
-   Major (3 HP): Heals after a day of rest
-   Severe (4 HP): Heals after an active break period
-   Drastic (5 HP):Heals after achieving a major milestone.

## Actions

As it stands, all cards are vital to the experience of the game.
Boons can be purchased for an additional 10 points base. When using a second boon, it triggers off the original card and the player gets to determine what effect occurs.

## Equipment

Characters can build equipment that allows their character to get extra bonuses or new abilities. Crafting a piece of equipment involves drafting a blueprint of its design, presenting it to the DM and paying the Total Value of build points required. More about building equipment can be found below.

## Skills

Minor Skill Upgrade (0->1 or 1->2): Point Value = Rank x1
Major Skill Upgrade (2->3 or 3->4): Point Value = Rank x2
Skill Mastery (4->5): Point Value = Rank x3
Skill Perfection (5->6): Major Milestone. Takes up an equipment slot.

## Contacts

A contact must have either a faction or profession. Contacts are split in 3 parts, Role, Loyalty and Resources. A Contact's role is what they represent to the player or what faction they are a part of. Loyalty is how much they trust you and can be trusted in return. Resources are how connected they are and what they are able to obtain for you.. When using a contact, make sure the contact's Role matches the favour they are trying to aska, make a Networking Roll and add the contacts Resources to determine whether they would have what is necessary and then Roll Rapport and add the Contact's loyalty to determine whether the contact would be willing to part with it.

One Build Point buys one point in either Loyalty or Resources.
