# Sense

1. _Refresh Self_
1. _Examine_
1. _Create a Defect_

## Examine

Examine allows the user to either perceive the length of a chain or its vanquish.

Using Examine to scout enemies is important for:

-   Making sure links of overcome are not wasted
-   Choosing which Vanquish to tackle first
-   Getting a judge of the enemy's strength
-   Scouting for clues on how the enemy will operate

## Defect

A Defect is an Aspect that an enemy has that is to their detriment. A player may utilise a Defect to make an Aspect roll. Like all Aspects, Defects may also be locked for Momentum. Defects can be used to attack an enemy with their own weak points. If a player is having trouble attacking with their proficient skills a player can set up Defects in order to enable them to continue Overcoming. A strength of Defects is they are specifically not skills, they may be used to bypass immunities or pivot the enemy into having to defend using a different skill.

A Good Defect is:

-   Usable easily by any team member
-   Makes sense as either a kryptonite or simple weakness of the enemy
-   Does not trivialise story stakes by making the enemy seem dumb

<Callout emoji={'ðŸ¤¯'} heading="Example Defect">
    The team are fighting a Giant Robot with an impenetrable armour detail which
    makes it immune to Target. The scientist creates the Defect "Explosive
    Prone." On the Gunners turn, he is able to Overcome using Explosive Prone
    for a +5 due to his Rocket Launcher detail. This allows the Gunner to
    describe him shooting the Robot despite it being immune to Target. Due to
    the way The Gunner has worded his equipment, they are also able to use some
    of them as the story describes him "Shooting" the enemy, despite not using
    Target.
