# Explore

Explore is simply the card that helps your character get around. Explore is used for getting to a zone of choice or taking a step off the page and discovering something of their own. When using Explore for movement, your turn is likely to be quite quick. When using it for Discover, make sure you've taken a moment to consider the zone you are creating and its narrative consequence on the story.

## Action

1.  Players in a zone you leave this turn may **<InlineDefine uppercase term='flip'/> 1** to follow you.
1.  **Move 2** or **Discover 1**
1.  THEN: Create A **Zone Detail**

## Keywords

-   **Follow** - Allows a player to copy a zone of movement of a Moving player.
-   **Discover** - Move into an undiscovered zone and define the assumed details by describing it

## Follow

Following is a very powerful mechanic that **_when used as a team can allow the party to save several turns of movement._** Follow is best used when grouped and acting as a unit. When you wish to Explore, it is worth mentioning to other allies in your zone that you intend to do so which will enable them to Follow and play their own action card instead of having to move and then do it. These turns can be pivotal.

**_Follow triggers after each point of movement._** If a player is moving two zones, a player following would Flip 1 to Follow into the first tile and then if they wished to continue following, would need to Flip again to follow into the second. It also means that a player can follow mid way through a character's movement. For example, if the detective moves into the library where the gunslinger is, and then into the lab, the gunslinger can follow him into the lab.

## Move

Movement between zones is merely for positioning your character to achieve their desired goals. When moving to and from zones, be wary of dangerous zone concepts or the range of enemies. **_The Move option is simply for getting between A and B as quickly as possible._**

## Discover

Discover allows a player to define an otherwise empty zone and move into it. Discover is a mechanic that allows the player to experience building the world as the encounter takes place. When Discovering, there are a few key things to remember:

-   The zone needs to make sense within the context of the scene. If the party is a hotel, there likely isn't an underground bunker in it. Build things that make sense, but also push the story forward. Using the hotel example, running from hotel room 100 into 101 and making the same detail while accurate, isn't necessarily dramatic. Of course, if you need your character to move but are struggling with something, feel free to throw in the first thing that comes to mind.
-   The DM can reject a Discover being used as a way to spawn in plot conveniences. For example, if the enemy has a kryptonite, you cannot simply spawn a Kryptonite machine in the next room. The player is also unable to spawn in rooms for the explicit purpose of farming BP. Nice try pal.
-   The DM decides the flexibility of Discover. Certain directives and story points will require a lot of Fixed Zones to keep continuity. However in other certain situations the player may be given total freedom to define everything. It is recommended that DMs do a mix of games to allow players the opportunity to experience both, but that may not always be the case depending on story context, DM style and varying other factors. For example, the game takes place in a wild area, so the DM institutes a Campaign Concept that when a player Discovers they draw a tile from a bag which could have Loot, Enemies or Challenges associated with it.

### Zones to Discover

Discover is used to travel to a tile that was otherwise inaccessible.

**Predetermined Zones:** A zone that has nothing in it that the DM has put on the board ahead of time. This can be prompted by the DM to allow players to build on the story world by defining a part of it or to ensure players stick within a certain boundary. Predetermined zones are often represented by a zone with a large question mark placed on the board.

**Undiscovered Zones:** Undiscovered Zones are zones that the DM has defined the player has been unable to access or perceive until entering them. When Discovering an Undiscovered zone, the DM informs the player what is in the zone. Once Discovered, an undiscovered zone becomes Discovered, allowing alternate movement effects to enter this zone. Discovering these zones can be important as Discovery movement is the only way in initially which will allow your team more options in their movement and positioning. Undiscovered zones are often represented by an eye icon in the zone.

**Difficult Terrain:** Difficult Terrain is a regular zone that requires Discovering to move in and out of. These zones are often there to either create an interesting challenge in the encounter by limiting movement or building a sense of discomfort and effort when moving between zones. Difficult terrain is often indicated by a mountain icon or a unique marker depending on the concept of the zone.

**Free Zones:** Unless the DM or Directive explicitly say otherwise, players are able to discover tiles by simply walking into an empty space on the board and stating what it is. These rules are often used in cases of player directed world building or when certain directive enable it such as the Flee Directive. Free Zones are when players should be the strictest in following the Discover guidelines, as the DM is trusting them to continue building a cohesive story world with them.

### Create a Zone Detail

When creating a Zone Detail with Explore, think in the simplest possible terms **_"What is something in this room that could be helpful or flavourful?"_** If nothing springs to mind, simply skip this step. This is a may text. Leaving a Zone Detail everywhere you go is not particularly fun or optimal and simply clutters the board. These zone details generally only come up to enable minor story progression or when interacting with concepts. Don't Overthink it.
