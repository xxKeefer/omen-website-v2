# Premise

A Premise is an assumed Concept that cannot be removed. The Premise is a concept so bound to the fabric of the world that to remove it would break the grounds of narrative permission. For example, a knight in shiny armour cannot simply remove gravity, it would destroy suspension of disbelief. Premises may include directives, scene themes or overarching campaign ideals, but may be as simple as "there is water in the ocean."
