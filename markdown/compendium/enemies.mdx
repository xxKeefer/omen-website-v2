# Enemies

## Name

Make sure to give your bad guy a memorable name.

## Aspects

An Aspect that allows this unit to use an Aspect Action. The amount of Aspects an enemy has determines the amount of re-rolls they will be able to use in a combat.

## Scene Concept

A unique rule that the scene follows. Some time the big bad brings the doom with with it.

        "You may not explore out of a zone you share with The Black Medusa."

## Skills

Skill points are assigned by the DM when creating the enemy. These skill points are used to attack and defend. For mooks and goons, it is not required for them to have a great amount of skills. With bigger enemies, it is good to give the enemy a variety of skills to defend with. Be meticulous when deciding which skills an enemy has, as often the difficulty of a monster can be determined by the amount of skill points it has.

## Skill Immunities

An enemy may start immune to a particular skill or skill group. This means that when defending with this skill, they automatically succeed on all rolls. Like all skills, when assigning immunities, it must make sense to the narrative. For example, a zombie does not care about how you talk to it, so is immune to the Social skill group. Immunities can be overwritten with certain gear and boons, but those are quite rare. Skill immunities can be ignored in situations where a player can orchestrate a way their skill can bypass the narrative permission that created the immunity.

## Monster Actions

Basic Overcome: Skill + Roll - Deal 1 Enemies must use the skill that makes the most sense to their character in that moment. If they become Obstructed, determine whether this skill is still viable to use with narrative permission. If so, use it. Do not use a different skill simply to avoid a player's Adapt unless it makes sense with the given narrative permission.

## Unique Overcome

Before overcoming, an enemy may declare they are using a unique overcome. If this unique overcome was not used as part of a routine, all allies targeted Refresh 1.

## Routines

A series of moves that an enemy uses, with it's final ability being it's ult. There must be at least 3 actions in any given routine. When an enemy starts a routine, the players get informed, and its moves are locked for the duration of the routine. All rolls in a routine are DC based. It is important when designing a routine to foreshadow the ultimate move heavily so the players may prepare. When players know its coming, it feels fairer when it has a big impact.

<Callout emoji="✨" heading="Generic Example Routine">
    <ul>
        <li>Turn 1: Upgraded Overcome</li>
        <li>Turn 2: Foreshadow with minor effect</li>
        <li>Turn 3: Ult</li>
    </ul>

# Ultimate

Ultimates are a super move that an enemy may use. An ultimate may only be used as part of a routine and must always be used at the end. A well designed ultimate will be easy to see coming and hard to deal with if it lands. Ultimates are a way to swing momentum into the enemies favour. Some of the ways to do that are

-   **Concepts:** that create serious advantages for the enemies. This means the players must invest time and effort into removing it
-   **Big Damage:** Nothing to add stakes like the threat of scars.
-   **Ticking Clock:** A defeat condition that the players must handle.
-   **Reinforcements:** More enemies, more danger. When using reinforcements make sure to consider the length of your combat. When adding more enemies, combat will take longer, and if the boss can constantly create enemies, it could create an infinite combat state.
-   **Anything:**. The ultimate move could be anything. If it's engaging, it's worth trying.

## Movement

An enemy may use its action to move, If it wishes to move before having an action, it can, however it must Refresh 1 to an ally in that zone. If there are no allies, it moves freely.

## Defense

Monsters must defend with the option that makes the most narrative sense. If the character is immune to the skill a player is attacking with, it automatically succeeds. When defending with an immunity, declare that the overcome has no effect before dice are rolled, and explain the narrative permission that allows the creature to defend in a cinematic way. When an enemy has been adapted, it is between the DM and the players to decide whether it still makes sense for the enemy to be able to defend with that skill based on the narrative permission allocated as part of the Adapt. For example, if an ally has an enemy's arms pinned, they may not be able to use Strike to defend. If however, the player has described their defense as the enemy having an opening in their guard, they may still attempt to defend with Strike.

An enemy's defense may be modified by the concepts that it has. This may allow an enemy to gain extra re-rolls, deflect damage or avoid certain skills.

<Callout emoji="✨" color='pink.900' heading="Example Defense Concepts">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Evening The Odds:</strong> When this creature rolls an odd number to defend, it adds +1 to it
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Balanced Measure:</strong>This enemy must re-roll all 1s and 8s.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prickly Exterior:</strong> If this enemy rolls an 8 to defend, the attacker takes 1.
        </li>
    </ul>

## Chains

Chains are representative of an enemy's health. The amount of chains an enemy has remains hidden at the start of the encounter and may be revealed with Identify actions. When a chain is closed, a player may Create A Drawback.

## Vanquish

A vanquish is an effect that occurs when a chain gets closed. These effects are designed to keep combat exciting and allow the story to develop. Vanquishes can allow enemies to become stronger, weaker, take extra actions, lose access to certain abilities or anything else that can create exciting moments in the story telling. When building vanquishes, it's often best to have a mix of vanquishes between helping the party and hindering them as it rewards them by identifying which order to target the chains in.
