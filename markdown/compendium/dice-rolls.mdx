# Types of Dice Rolls

## Trait Roll

Before rolling, a character may lock any available Trait to replace their skill roll. A Trait Roll uses the narrative permission of the Trait that was locked and grants a modifier of +5.

## Momentum Roll

Momentum is a narrative permission that must be followed in order to be used. Each player starts the game by creating a Momentum but it can also be created by either a successful Overcome or the Help action. A Momentum roll can be made after any roll by either burning a Momentum or locking an Aspect. A Momentum roll grants a +2 or a re-roll to an already existing roll.

## Invention Roll

The first step of making an Invention roll is to tell the story of what the player wishes their character to do. After that has been described, the player and DM should work together to properly decide which of the Invention actions best describes what the player is attempting. If the player is trying to bend the rules of the game, take a bit of extra time to consider the consequences for the encounter. The key rule with Inventions is that the player describes what happens and the DM defines the result in terms of game mechanics.

The base DC for any Invention roll is 13. This however can be modified in several ways

-   Active Details relevant to the situation grant +2 to the roll
-   Power Scaling: The DC for any roll is designed to emulate the perceived difficulty of the task. In certain circumstances the DM may elect to raise the DC to balance the power of what the player is trying to do to the roll that should be required for it. For example If the character intends on doing something theyâ€™d find challenging, the player and DM have come to an agreement on a powerful resolution that requires a higher DC than normal or the Invention will have massive implications on the encounter.
-   Rule of Cool: When the character realistically shouldn't be able to but the DM wants to see what happens, they can choose to up the DC as a counterbalance.
-   Dramatic Tension: The DM may at any point up the DC of an Invention roll to add stakes to it. We recommend that DMs use this sparingly and only for critical moments.

## Overcome Roll

An Overcome roll is used to close chains. When overcoming, the first step is to choose which chain this character is attempting to overcome. Then, the player must describe how they wish to Overcome the situation and which skill they intend to use. Once the player has described the narrative of their Overcome, the DM describes how the enemy or encounter defends and which skill they are defending with. Both sides roll openly. After both sides have rolled, they may begin using Aspects and Momentum to manipulate the results. This is done simultaneously and the side with the highest total wins.

Once both sides are done, the DM lets the player know if they succeeded. On a success, the player deals a link of damage to the chain they selected. If they succeed by more than double, then they "Succeed with Style." Succeeding with Style means the player deals an additional link of damage and may apply one of the following effects

-   Create a Defect on the Enemy
-   Examine this Enemy
-   Refresh Any Player 1

## Unlock Roll

To unlock a Trait, the player must describe the Trait that they wish to unlock, how their character unlocks it and which skill they intend on using to do so. They then make a skill roll to determine whether they were successful. The DC is dependant on whether it is an enemy or ally:

-   On an ally, the DC is equal to 6+ the number of light tokens of the target
-   On an enemy, the DC is equal to 6+ the number of light tokens of the user
