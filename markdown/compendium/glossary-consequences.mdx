# Consequences

### Consequences are health boxes with varying amounts

-   **Minor:** 1 health per box
-   **Moderate:** 2 health per box
-   **Major:** 3 health per box
-   **Severe:** 4 health per box
-   **Drastic:** 5 health per box

-   **Scars:** A trait a character gains when dropping to 0.
-   **Surviving:** Character cannot be targeted by enemies. At the end of each round the character must discard one of their cards from play. When the character runs out of cards they are unable to take actions but are still able to help with narrative permission
-   **Enduring:** Each time a character takes damage they remove one of their cards from play, once out of cards the character is rendered completely incapacatated and takes an additional scar.
-   **Inspiring:** The character goes down in such a way that inspires allies to continue fighting. This character creates an advantage and then removes all their cards from play. In return every ally who witnesses this may refresh 1 and unlock an aspect. The character then becomes incapacitated and cannot be targeted by enemies
-   **Scar Aspects**: An aspect a character gains as part of taking a Scar. The DM can invoke it but a player cannot.
-   **TPK:** When all the players drop to 0 consequences
