# Momentum (Formerly Advantages)

Momentum is a small detail that bears no narrative permission. When utilising Momentum, the character must describe how the narrative detail applies to their character in this situation. Momentum can be used after a roll to grant either +2 or a re-roll. Momentum is created by both the Help and Overcome actions, but Aspects, Defects and Scars may also become locked in order to be used as Momentum instead of their intended purpose.
