An aspect is a tagline on a scene that helps describe it. The four types of aspects are all different and are used for different things. The four types of aspects are:

    Most Aspects are either be ASSUMED or ACTIVE, sometimes they can be Given.
    The definitions for each are below
    <hr />
    <strong>ASSUMED:</strong> Something so obvious and core to the narrative it
    cannot be added or removed, it simply exists. <br />
    <strong>GIVEN:</strong> Something perhaps not pbvious but still very core to
    the narrative and cannot be removed. In a Space Opera setting this might be some
    like <em>"SciFi Physics."</em> Which implies you may be able to dodge lasers
    fire from ray guns even though they travel at the speed of light. <br />
    <strong>ACTIVE:</strong> Something that is created by a player and
    introduced into the active game state. <br />

## Momentum

Advantages are some phrase that describes something cool that just happened or the feeling of what is happening. When created they reference some fleeting moment of action in the game in some abstract way, and when used players must find a way to use the phrase in reference to the current action happening in the moment.

## Detail

A narrative permission that allows player's to do things they otherwise wouldn't be able to do.

## Concept

A rule that defines the way a scene operates. This often involves story defining details, world ideals, themes and environmental consistencies.

## Premise

An assumed Concept that cannot be removed. May include directives, scene themes or overarching campaign ideals.
