    In a variant of Omen known as{' '}
    <strong>
        <em>SUPER ULTRA OMEN</em>
    </strong>{' '}
    which is a super hero setting, players get twice as many Omen tokens but
    those tokens also act as the players health. This creates a dynami knife's
    edge feeling as HP becomes like more of a stamina meter.
