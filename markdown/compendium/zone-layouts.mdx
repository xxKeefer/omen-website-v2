# Zone Layouts

The way a DM sets up the Zones for a session is called a “Layout”, Omen is all about creative freedom so the following aspects of Layouts are not the only things you can consider but it gives a good starting point. The first question you need to ask about Zones for a scenario is, who gets to choose where the Zones go?

## Free Zones

The default mode for Omen is that the players get to decide. When they EXPLORE off an edge of a Zone into new territory they chose what the Zone is. Normally the Zone would have to make sense in the setting. You aren't going to suddenly stumble into an arctic wasteland in the middle of a desert for example. This mode is best for collaborative storytelling where the DM and the players work together to tell something epic and everyone gets a turn to be surprised at what comes next. It also shines when there are now constraints or puzzle solving required for the scenario; it can just be all out chaos.

## Fixed Zones

Fixed Zones are on the opposite side of the spectrum, in advance the DM decides exactly what zones are going to appear on the board, and exactly how they are placed on the play area. This mode shines when you really have a specific motif, vibe, puzzle or story to get across to the players. For example, a survival horror where opening the next door and EXPLORING into the next zone could hide something terrible inside. As a DM you want total control over the zones so you can spring the monster at the right moment.

## Predetermined Zones

Somewhere in the middle we have Predetermined Zones, the DM lays out many Zones in advance with the word "Unknown" or a question mark drawn on it. These act like nodes that players can EXPLORE to. So to put it simply the DM gets to choose where the zones exist, the players get to choose what they are. This mode is best at creating a sense of distance between the players and their objective. This can be combined with a PRESSURE BAR to create a real sense of urgency. A good example is think of a person tied to the railroad track and the players have to save them before the train comes but there's ten Zones between them but the train arrives in seven turns Oh NO!

### Hidden Zones

Sometimes it can be fun for a DM to plan their scenario with a hidden Zone. Think about the hidden revolving bookcase door that you only can access if you investigate and discover it. It can be an excellent way to reward characters that like to be perceptive or an interesting puzzle where a villain disappears suddenly but your players know they can't be far away. It can also be used to great effect in Fixed or Predetermined layouts where there is an Unknown Zone on the board just tempting the players to investigate and then when they try to EXPLORE into it the DM tells them with a cheeky grin "There is no obvious way to access that zone".

# Layout Orientation

Layout Orientation refers to how your Zones connect and relate to each other. It is important to note that the orientation can be either very strict, ignored entirely or have different orientations in distinct parts of the layout. It's entirely up to you and your players.

## Horizontal Layouts

Horizontal layouts where you choose to think of your Zones from an aerial top down view. In the following images the players in a super hero game we're challenged to save civilians and defeat various villains around the city. If you look closely at the art cards you can get the feel that these are almost like city blocks. The kind of view you get from a map, the directions on the board are North, East, South and West. This is generally the default mode for Omen. It is good to create a sprawling landscape ripe for exploration and discovery without having to think too hard about how things fit together.

## Vertical Layouts

Vertical Layouts are where you choose to think of your layouts as a side view. Think of it like a side scroller video game, the directions on the board are now Up, Right, Down and Left. In the following image the same superheroes from the previous scenario encountered small-time crooks trying to rob a gas station. You can see the bottom row are Zones that represent the inside of the gas station, the middle row represents the street or ground level and the tiles above that represent the sky and roof tops. This Layout is good for creating a sense of realism and groundedness and the tableau created by all the zones together is almost like looking at a photograph of the scene. The draw back of this layout is that the scale of distance tends to be a lot smaller. What this means is that your players theoretically could explore left and right infinitely, perhaps even downwards, but the sky's the limit for up. Unless you have characters that can fly or enter outer space. Or perhaps you are in a tall skyscraper. You can also get dynamic with Zone adjacency, for example it would make sense in this scene that all the bottom tiles are adjacent to each other because the gas station interior is relatively small. It also makes sense that all tiles excluding the bottom tiles are adjacent to the top two tiles as everywhere outdoors in the art cards has sky or rooftops.
