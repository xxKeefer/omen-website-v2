Count the amount of proficiencies put into each Approach, the one that has the most is the characters is the Star. Then count the number of proficiencies put in each talent, that one that has the most becomes the character's Sign. If there is a tie, the player may choose which they prefer out of their options. Once these are known, the player can find the characters Star Sign using the following table.

## Custom Signs

Players may make their own if they are approved by a DM. Star signs are meant to be minor rules that give a small unique perk. Star signs are meant for flavour and not to add severe power scaling to a character. Question the intention of your players who attempt to use this to add power to their character.
