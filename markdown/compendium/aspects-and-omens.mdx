# Aspects and Omens

## Aspects

At the start of the game, the DM will decide 3-5 categories that the players will have as aspects. An aspect is a short catchy phrase that describes the character. These aspects should be used to develop the character, but also kept vague so they may be more easily used for Omens.

    For Example, a character <em>Bob The Bountyhunter</em> might have the
    following aspect. <strong>Goal: That One that Got Away.</strong>
</Callout>

In a game session each aspect can only be tagged once. **BEFORE** making a roll for a skill check, a player may instead Flip 1 to forego electing a skill to tag an aspect. This _"Aspect Roll"_ will be at +5. If a player wishes to tag an aspect **AFTER** a roll has been made, it will grant a +2 or a re-roll.

<Callout emoji="✨" color="pink.900" heading="Aspect Rolls">
    For example: "I don't have a good roll to defend against Technology. So
    instead, I will tag that I am an <strong>'Eccentric Maniac'</strong> that is
    impossible to predict and roll with a +5.
</Callout>

## Star

The character's Star Sheet determines their **"Luck"**. A Star Sheet has tokens equivalent to the rules of the Star they choose that can be used by both the player and DM to weave fate. A player will normally start with 3-5 omen tokens at the beginning of a game. Omen tokens can be tagged in a situation where an aspect either created in the game or on the player's sheet fits the situation. When tagged, the character receives either a +2 or a re-roll to their current action. An aspect may only be tagged once per game. It is the responsibility of the DM to determine whether the Aspect fits the situation once the Player has requested to flip an Omen token. Players may flip Light omens Dark, and the DM vice versa. If a Star Sheet becomes completely Light the character is considered "Blessed", and the events of the story will lean in their favour. If a Star Sheet becomes completely Dark the character is considered **"Doomed"**, and the events of the story will lean against them. When an event in the story could go either way, a DM may nominate to refer to their Star Sheet to determine which way the Star's have designated the event goes. A character's Star Sheet resets at the beginning of every game.

### Starsigns from Launch

<Callout emoji="⚠️" color="orange.500" heading="Experimental Feature">
    Not all Starsigns are functional, this game is still in active development
    and it is recommended that you make characters with the{' '}
    <strong>Agnostic</strong> starsign which is the default for Omen to begin
    and then create your own starsigns to suit your needs.
</Callout>

#### Functional Starigns

        well

**The Agnostic (Default):** The standard array. 5 omens. 3 light, 2 dark.

**The Endless Machine:** A player may instead of flipping a token, take a Moderate or higher consequence of damage.

**The Story-Teller:** During character creation, when creating aspects, flip an omen token to decide whether they are positive or negative. Each Aspect is assigned Dark or Light depending on if it is positive or negative. Regardless of all other factors, start each game with the story told layout.

**The Gemini:** The player may only flip tokens to do an action that is considered "Pragmatic." The DM may only flip tokens to do an action that is considered "Empathetic". If either flips a token to do the other, they become Blessed/Cursed.

**The Gambler:** This character is immune to Bless and Curse. Instead of flipping a token, flip the coin and call. On a success, use the flip. On a fail, you cannot flip the coin for the rest of this action. If the coin is refreshed, create an advantage.

**The Cryptic Swan:** When blessed, humans and computers see Janus. When cursed, humans and computers see The Cryptic Swan. When neither, computers perceive the Cryptic Swan and humans perceive Janus. When Janus flips a token, these are momentarily reversed with "a distinct style."

**Man in the Mirror:** When the DM flips a token, create an ally advantage. When Versteckt flips a token, it creates an enemy advantage.

**The Dealer:** This character starts the game with a coin instead of Omens. When holding the coin, this character is blessed. When the DM holds the coin, this character is cursed. When the character flips, if they pass the flip, they succeed the roll and passes the DM the coin. If they fail, they pass the coin to the DM and may not burn advantages on this action. When the DM flips the coin, they follow the same rules with the addition it must target this character. When the coin is refreshed, whoever holds the coin creates an advantage.

#### Experimental or Legacy Starigns

<Callout emoji="️💥" color="red.700" heading="Borked Feature">
    <em>
        These starsigns are either not seeing use in playtests. Some times due
        to them not making sense in the current version of the rules, or
        sometimes they seem to break the game in some cases. This doesn't mean
        not to use them, it just means that DM's and players may have to be
        prepared to make some on the fly game rulings during play on how to
        resolve the edge cases
    </em>
</Callout>

**The Seven :** The Seven may only be flipped to invoke a particular action. The Seven start with 4 flipped Light, and 3 flipped Dark.

-   The Father: Create
-   The Mother: Remove
-   The Maiden: Move
-   The Crone: Delay
-   The Warrior: Overcome
-   The Smith: Adjust
-   The Stranger: Identify

**The One Eyed Almighty:** 5 tokens: 3 Dark, 2 Light. A character may only flip omens if committing an action that is considered to be Lawful, Merciful, Honourable or Dutiful. The DM may deny a flip if it is deemed not to be in service of Righteousness. You may adjust the tenants according to the setting.

**The Monkey's Paw:** 3 omens. The monkey's paw does not grant Blessed or Cursed. The character may use 3 omens per day that are considered an automatic success (within reason). But if they use an omen token, something terrible occurs.

**The Good Twin :** 3 omens. 3 Light. At the start of the day, the player nominates someone as their Evil twin. The Evil twin has access to the Good Twins Omen tokens as well as their own. If either player becomes Cursed, both players do.
