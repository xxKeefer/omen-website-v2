# Zonal Combat

Most of the time when using zones in the area of play, it is to describe a battlefield. The following section describes how to use zones in your combat to make them more then just boxes to place your character tokens.

## Utility Maneuvers

Utility Maneuvers are an optional rule set that can be utilized for making interesting Monster actions and player BOONS. Utility Maneuvers are where players can choose to opt out of closing CHAINS or doing damage to instead make some kind of maneuver. This list covers only maneuvers pertaining to Zones and there could be many more maneuvers you could define, these are just common examples.

### Eject

Move the target or targets out of the current zone, typically to an adjacent zone.

### Pull

Move the target or targets, typically from an adjacent zone, into the current zone.
