# Zonal Combat

Most of the time when using zones in the area of play, it is to describe a battlefield. The following section describes how to use zones in your combat to make them more then just boxes to place your character tokens.

## Melee and Ranged Attacks

Using the OVERCOME card is the primary way to defeat the challenges during combat. OVERCOME is a very versatile card. If you are in the same Zone you can try and succeed in a skill challenge to close chains. If you aren't close enough you can FLIP to move a zone before the skill challenge. And finally if you want to keep your distance from the threat you can trade damage for safety and do little less damage but from range.

### Melee

Melee OVERCOMES are those that happen in the same zone as the target of the skill challenge. These OVERCOMES close two chains or and an additional chain if you succeed with style.

### Ranged

If you don't want to get up close, you can also OVERCOME targets that are in ADJACENT Zones by doing a Ranged OVERCOME. These OVERCOMES close one chain and an additional chain if you succeed with style.

## Utility Maneuvers

Utility Maneuvers are an optional ruleset that can be utilized for making interesting Monster actions and player BOONS. Utility Maneuvers are where players can choose to opt out of closing CHAINS or doing damage to instead make some kind of maneuver. This list covers only maneuvers pertaining to Zones and there could be many more maneuvers you could define, these are just common examples.

### Eject

Move the target or targets out of the current zone, typically to an adjacent zone.

### Pull

Move the target or targets, typically from an adjacent zone, into the current zone.
