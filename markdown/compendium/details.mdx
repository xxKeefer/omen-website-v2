# Details

Details are the defined narrative elements of a scene. They are used to justify the viability of a particular action in the narrative. These "narrative permissions" are utilised within games to allow characters to do things they otherwise wouldn't be able to. While what a Detail is has infinite possibilities, they fall into two categories, assumed or <InlineDefine term='active'/>. An assumed detail is a detail that exists within the scene that is obvious enough that it does not need to be pointed out. It can be assumed that in an Ocean Zone, there would be water, therefore the Detail water does not need to be created. Assumed details have no effect on the mechanics of the game until a player begins to use them as part of their storytelling.

## Active Detail

An Active detail must be created by a card which will allow a character to do something that it otherwise would not be able to. Active details effect creating concepts, justifying a skill usage, or the way a zone operates.These details enable a player to justify why their character would be able to do something within a scene. "I do X because of Y". In this instance, X is the description of the action they are taking and Y is the detail they have created. Whether something works or does not work depends on the context of the scene and is ultimately decided by the DM with input from the players.

    My character cannot access the sky zone because they cannot fly. I Explore
    into the secret laboratory creating the Zone Detail{' '}
    <em>"weird experiments."</em> On my next turn, I Interact with the secret
    laboratory and invoke the <em>"weird experiments."</em> detail to create the
    Character Detail <em>"I have a jetpack."</em> My character{' '}
    <strong>can now fly</strong>, and therefore can now access the sky zone.

## Character Detail

A character detail is a narrative permission that exists involving a character. When creating a character detail, a player may invoke their aspects, another detail or a concept in order to justify to the table that the action is viable. Examples of a Character Detail includes equipping an item, interacting with an effect that is currently affecting the character, or a character altering itself in some way that extends it's narrative permission.

<Callout emoji="✨" heading="Example of Character Detail Effects">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Access to New Things:</strong> I create the Character Detail
            "I have a jetpack" which narratively lets me fly. I can now access
            the Sky Zone.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Enable Skills:</strong> This enemy has immunity to Shoot due
            to it's kevlar. I create the Character detail{' '}
            <em>"I have a Rocket Launcher"</em>, now I can Overcome this enemy
            with Shoot.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Effects:</strong> My character is bleeding. They take one
            damage at the start of each of their turns.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Zone Manipulation:</strong> I am in the Bush Fire zone. I
            created the Character Concept "Hose". I am now able to modify the
            zone with Invent to remove the fire from the zone.
        </li>
    </ul>
</Callout>

# Enemy Detail

Enemy details is a narrative permission that involves an enemy. These work just like character details, except they describe a way in which the enemy is hindered. These small hindrances may reflavour the way that enemies perform actions or routines but cannot directly change the information on the character's sheet. Details that are created on an enemy are added based on the narrative of Overcomes that have been used on the enemy. As with all game changing Details and Concepts, the player decides the narrative and the DM decides the effect.

<Callout emoji="✨" heading="Example of Enemy Detail Effects">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Targeted Shot:</strong> I hit them in the arm. They're now
            less likely to use their arms.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Creating Opportunity:</strong> I pierce the door of the
            helicopter and may now enter it.
        </li>
    </ul>
</Callout>

## Zone Detail

A zone detail is a narrative permission that exists involving a zone. When creating a zone detail, a player defines something within the zone that affects how it operates. This could include an object of significance, a potential hazard or a vivid description of the scenery.

<Callout emoji="✨" heading="Examples of Zone Details">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Item:</strong> This zone has a computer terminal.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Potential Hazard:</strong> This zone is on fire.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Defined Terrain:</strong> This zone is on a hill.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Noteable Scene Influence:</strong> This zone has a notable
            thing in it.
        </li>
    </ul>
</Callout>
